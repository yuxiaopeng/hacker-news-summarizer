所提供的内容仅包含“Qwen”一词，不足以生成传统的文章摘要。然而，基于标题“Qwen3-Max-Thinking”，以下是该标题可能涉及的背景及技术趋势摘要：

**Qwen3-Max-Thinking 概览**
该标题指的是阿里云通义千问（Qwen）模型家族的一个理论上或即将推出的迭代版本。虽然目前的旗舰模型是 Qwen2.5，但“Qwen3-Max-Thinking”预示着一个针对高级认知任务进行优化的下一代模型。

**核心预测特性：**
*   **推理能力（“Thinking”）：** “Thinking”后缀表明该模型旨在与“推理型”模型（如 OpenAI 的 o1 或阿里巴巴的 QwQ）竞争。这些模型利用**强化学习（RL）**和**思维链（CoT）**技术在输出前进行“思考”，使其在数学、编程和复杂逻辑处理方面表现卓越。
*   **规模（“Max”）：** 在 Qwen 生态系统中，“Max”通常代表规模最大、功能最强的闭源版本，旨在提供企业级性能和极高的参数复杂度。
*   **战略演进：** 从 Qwen2.5 向 Qwen3 的跨越，可能标志着向**系统 2 思维（System 2 thinking）**的转变。在这种模式下，AI 能够比标准大语言模型更可靠地进行自我纠错并处理多步复杂问题。

**结论：**
虽然未提供正式文章，但“Qwen3-Max-Thinking”一词代表了阿里巴巴 AI 开发的前沿：一个旨在弥合简单文本生成与自主逻辑问题解决之间差距的大规模、高推理引擎。

## 2. MapLibre Tile: a modern and efficient vector tile format

**原文标题**: MapLibre Tile: a modern and efficient vector tile format

**原文链接**: [https://maplibre.org/news/2026-01-23-mlt-release/](https://maplibre.org/news/2026-01-23-mlt-release/)

MapLibre has announced the launch of **MapLibre Tile (MLT)**, a new open-source vector tile format designed to succeed Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT). Developed to handle modern geospatial data volumes and next-generation graphics APIs, MLT focuses on high performance for planet-scale 2D and 2.5D basemaps.

**Key Features and Benefits:**
*   **Superior Compression:** Utilizing a column-oriented layout with recursive encodings, MLT offers up to a **6x improvement in compression** over large MVT tiles. This leads to significantly lower storage costs, reduced egress fees, and better cache utilization.
*   **Enhanced Performance:** The format is optimized for modern hardware, allowing for faster decoding through SIMD instructions. It is designed to be loaded into GPU buffers with minimal processing, streamlining both CPU and GPU workflows.
*   **Future-Proofing:** MLT is built to support upcoming needs, including 3D elevation data, complex nested properties, and linear referencing (m-values) to accommodate formats like Overture Maps (GeoParquet).

**Current Status and Integration:**
MLT currently maintains feature parity with MVT (with the exception of mixed-type columns). It is available for immediate use in **MapLibre GL JS** and **MapLibre Native** by updating the source encoding property to `mlt` in the style JSON. 

Developers can experiment with the format using the MLT-based demotiles style, an MVT-to-MLT encoding server, or the upcoming version of Planetiler for production tile generation. The project was a collaborative effort involving academia and industry, with significant financial backing from **Microsoft and AWS**.

## 4. 电视今天100岁了。

**原文标题**: Television is 100 years old today

**原文链接**: [https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2026/01/tv100.html](https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2026/01/tv100.html)

On January 26, 2026, television marked its centenary, celebrating 100 years since John Logie Baird’s first official demonstration to the press at 22 Frith Street, Soho. 

Baird, a Scottish engineer, began his pioneering work in Hastings using improvised materials like hatboxes, darning needles, and bicycle lenses. After a lab accident forced him to move to London in 1924, he refined his electro-mechanical "Televisor." Early experiments featured a ventriloquist dummy named "Stooky Bill" and later William Taynton, the first human to be televised. The decisive 1926 demonstration used spinning discs to transmit images with gradations of light and shade, a breakthrough reported by *The Times* despite initial skepticism from some observers.

Baird was a prolific inventor who went on to prototype color television, stereoscopic (3D) TV, and early video recording ("Phonovision"). However, his mechanical system faced stiff competition from Marconi-EMI’s electronic system. When the BBC launched the world’s first regular high-definition service from Alexandra Palace in 1936, the two systems were trialed side-by-side. The electronic system proved superior and was adopted as the standard after only three months.

Baird’s later years were marked by misfortune, including the destruction of his studios in the Crystal Palace fire and the suspension of broadcasting during WWII. He died in 1946, just as the BBC restarted its television service. 

Today, the site of his Soho workshop is home to the famous Bar Italia and is recognized as an official "World Origin Site." While his mechanical technology was eventually superseded, Baird is remembered as the primary catalyst for one of the most transformative inventions of the 20th century.

## 6. Exactitude in Science – Borges (1946) [pdf]

**原文标题**: Exactitude in Science – Borges (1946) [pdf]

**原文链接**: [https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Borges.pdf](https://kwarc.info/teaching/TDM/Borges.pdf)

《论科学的精确性》（西班牙语原题：*Del rigor en la ciencia*）是豪尔赫·路易斯·博尔赫斯于1946年出版的一篇著名的单段式短篇小说。该作品以一位虚构的17世纪作家的笔名写就，是一则关于表征、地图与现实之本质的哲学寓言。

**核心要点：**
*   **追求完美：** 故事描述了一个古老的帝国，其制图术达到了极端的精确程度，仅一省之地的地图就占据了整座城市的规模。
*   **1:1 比例：** 最终，制图师公会制作了一幅与帝国版图完全等大的地图，与物理领土“点对点”地完全重合。
*   **精确性的失败：** 后来几代人不再沉迷于制图学研究，他们意识到此类地图体量巨大且毫无实用价值。由于它没有对世界进行任何抽象或简化，因此无法提供认知或导航价值。
*   **过时与废墟：** 地图最终被遗弃在“日晒冬寒”之中。故事结尾提到，在西部的沙漠中，人们仍能发现被动物和乞丐占据的破烂地图遗迹——这是帝国地理雄心仅存的遗迹。

**关键信息：**
博尔赫斯利用这篇微型小说批判了“细节越多等于科学越好”的观念。其核心主题是**地图与疆域的关系**：一个模型只有在作为简化手段时才是有用的。如果一个表征变得与其试图描述的现实一样复杂，它就失去了存在的意义，从一种工具变成了障碍。

## 7. Google AI 概览在针对健康查询的回答中，引用 YouTube 的频率超过了任何医疗网站。

**原文标题**: Google AI Overviews cite YouTube more than any medical site for health queries

**原文链接**: [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/google-ai-overviews-youtube-medical-citations-study](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/google-ai-overviews-youtube-medical-citations-study)

A study by SEO platform SE Ranking has found that Google’s AI Overviews cite YouTube more than any hospital network, government health portal, or medical association when answering health-related queries. Analyzing over 50,000 searches in Germany, the researchers discovered that YouTube was the single most cited domain, accounting for 4.43% of all citations.

The findings have sparked concern among health experts and researchers who argue that while YouTube hosts content from licensed professionals, it is a general-purpose platform where anyone—including influencers with no medical training—can upload information. Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher at the University of Basel, suggested the data indicates that Google’s AI may prioritize "visibility and popularity" over "medical reliability," creating structural risks for public health.

The study follows previous reports of AI Overviews providing "dangerous" medical advice, such as inaccurate information regarding liver function tests. Researchers noted that even in a strictly regulated environment like Germany, the AI relied heavily on non-authoritative sources, suggesting the issue could be widespread.

Google defended the tool, stating that AI Overviews are designed to surface high-quality content regardless of format. The company noted that many of the cited YouTube videos are produced by reputable hospitals and clinics. Google also emphasized that the study focused specifically on German-language queries and may not accurately reflect how the tool performs in other regions or languages. However, the researchers cautioned that while a small sample of top-cited videos came from medical channels, they represented less than 1% of the total YouTube links cited, leaving the reliability of the remaining sources in question.
