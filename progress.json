    "summary": "Tailscale has announced the General Availability (GA) of **Tailscale Peer Relays**, a production-ready feature that allows users to deploy their own high-throughput relays on any Tailscale node. While Tailscale typically prioritizes direct peer-to-peer connections, Peer Relays provide a tailnet-native solution for maintaining connectivity in environments where firewalls or NAT constraints block direct paths.\n\nThe GA release introduces several significant enhancements:\n\n*   **Improved Performance:** Throughput has been significantly boosted by optimizing packet handling, reducing lock contention, and spreading traffic across multiple UDP sockets. Clients also now use more intelligent interface selection to ensure the highest possible connection quality.\n*   **Static Endpoints for Cloud Environments:** For restrictive settings where automatic endpoint discovery is impossible—such as instances behind AWS Network Load Balancers—users can now configure fixed IP/port pairs using the `--relay-server-static-endpoints` flag. This allows Peer Relays to provide high-performance connectivity even in heavily firewalled subnets, often serving as a more robust alternative to traditional subnet routers.\n*   **Enhanced Visibility:** Peer Relays are now fully integrated into Tailscale’s observability suite. Users can use `tailscale ping` to diagnose relay health and impact on latency. Furthermore, new metrics for forwarded packets and bytes can be exported to monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for long-term auditing and health tracking.\n\nPeer Relays are available on all Tailscale plans, including the Personal tier. They can be enabled via the CLI and managed through tailnet ACLs, maintaining Tailscale’s core principles of end-to-end encryption and simple, secure operation.",
    "chinese_title": "Tailscale Peer Relays 现已正式发布",
    "chinese_summary": "Tailscale 宣布 **Tailscale Peer Relays** 正式发布 (GA)。这是一项生产就绪的功能，允许用户在任何 Tailscale 节点上部署自己的高吞吐量中继。虽然 Tailscale 通常优先使用直接的点对点连接，但 Peer Relays 为防火墙或 NAT 限制导致无法建立直接路径的环境提供了一种 tailnet 原生的连接方案。\n\nGA 版本引入了多项重大改进：\n\n*   **性能提升：** 通过优化数据包处理、减少锁竞争以及在多个 UDP 套接字之间分散流量，大幅提升了吞吐量。客户端现在还采用更智能的接口选择，以确保最佳的连接质量。\n*   **云环境静态端点：** 针对无法进行自动端点发现的受限环境（例如 AWS 网络负载均衡器背后的实例），用户现在可以使用 `--relay-server-static-endpoints` 标志配置固定的 IP/端口对。这使得 Peer Relays 即使在受到严格防火墙保护的子网中也能提供高性能连接，通常是比传统子网路由器更稳健的替代方案。\n*   **增强的可观测性：** Peer Relays 现已完全集成到 Tailscale 的可观测性套件中。用户可以使用 `tailscale ping` 诊断中继运行状况及其对延迟的影响。此外，转发的数据包和字节数等新指标可以导出到 Prometheus 和 Grafana 等监控工具，用于长期审计和状态追踪。\n\nPeer Relays 适用于包括个人版在内的所有 Tailscale 套餐。用户可以通过 CLI 启用并通过 tailnet ACL 进行管理，这保持了 Tailscale 端到端加密以及简单、安全操作的核心原则。"

    "url": "https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/7287",
    "summary": "On October 28, 2025, PocketBase maintainer Gani Georgiev announced the cancellation of the project’s sponsorship from the FLOSS/fund. Although the funding was intended to support a year of full-time development, Gani withdrew the application due to regulatory constraints and privacy concerns. \n\nThe funder (Zerodha) was unable to process the sponsorship through GitHub and instead requested a direct wire transfer from India. Gani declined this method, citing discomfort with sharing sensitive personal data through insecure channels and a lack of trust in the required cross-jurisdictional paperwork. Gani acknowledged that announcing the funding before disbursal was a mistake but maintained that the project's goals remain intact.\n\nDespite the financial setback, the primary objective is still to reach a stable PocketBase release by the end of the year. The current development focus is a major UI rewrite designed to enable dashboard customization and extensibility (plugins). \n\nTo ensure long-term maintainability and avoid complex build dependencies, Gani is moving away from Svelte in favor of **Shablon**, a custom, zero-dependency framework written in plain JavaScript. Shablon uses native DOM elements and a simple reactivity model, allowing users to extend the UI without requiring a Node.js build step. This aligns with Gani's vision of making PocketBase a \"complete\" project with minimal external dependencies.\n\nPocketBase has entered a temporary \"feature freeze\" while the UI rewrite and a new UI kit are developed. Gani requested patience from the community as he navigates these changes without the previously expected full-time funding.",

    "title": "Windows: Prefer the Native API over Win32",
    "url": "https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31131",
    "summary": "In this Zig project issue, creator Andrew Kelley proposes a fundamental shift in how the Zig standard library interacts with Windows: prioritizing the **Windows Native API (`ntdll.dll`)** over the traditional **Win32 API (`kernel32.dll`, `advapi32.dll`, etc.)**.\n\nThe proposal outlines several key motivations for this change:\n\n*   **Reduced Overhead:** Most Win32 functions are merely wrappers around Native API calls. Interacting directly with `ntdll` eliminates unnecessary indirection, potentially improving performance and reducing binary size.\n*   **Technical Precision:** The Native API provides more granular control and access to features that are occasionally obfuscated or limited by the Win32 subsystem. This includes better handling of NT-style paths (starting with `\\??\\`) and more robust file system operations.\n*   **Minimal Dependencies:** By targeting the lowest level of the user-mode hierarchy, Zig binaries become less dependent on higher-level subsystem DLLs. This allows Zig code to run in environments where the Win32 subsystem may not be available or initialized, such as during the early system boot process or in specialized \"Native\" applications.\n*   **Consistency:** The shift aims to make the Windows implementation of the Zig standard library more \"principled\" by treating the NT kernel as the primary target, rather than a legacy subsystem.\n\nThe issue acknowledges that while the Native API is technically \"undocumented\" and subject to change by Microsoft, its core functionality has remained remarkably stable for decades. The plan involves refactoring Zig’s standard library to use `ntdll` for core OS tasks like memory management, file I/O, and thread handling, using Win32 only when necessary for specific high-level functionality. This move aligns with Zig's philosophy of providing low-level control and avoiding hidden abstractions.",
    "chinese_title": "Windows：优先使用原生 API 而非 Win32",
    "chinese_summary": "在这个 Zig 项目议题中，创始人 Andrew Kelley 提议对 Zig 标准库与 Windows 的交互方式进行根本性的转变：优先采用 **Windows Native API (`ntdll.dll`)**，而非传统的 **Win32 API（`kernel32.dll`、`advapi32.dll` 等）**。\n\n该提议概述了这一转变的几个关键动机：\n\n*   **减少开销：** 大多数 Win32 函数仅仅是 Native API 调用的封装。直接与 `ntdll` 交互消除了不必要的间接层，从而有望提升性能并减小二进制文件体积。\n*   **技术精准度：** Native API 提供了更细粒度的控制，并允许访问有时被 Win32 子系统掩盖或限制的功能。这包括对 NT 风格路径（以 `\\??\\` 开头）更好的处理以及更稳健的文件系统操作。\n*   **最小化依赖：** 通过面向用户模式层级的最底层，Zig 二进制文件对高级子系统 DLL 的依赖程度降低。这使得 Zig 代码能够在 Win32 子系统不可用或尚未初始化的环境中运行，例如系统早期启动过程或专门的“原生 (Native)”应用程序。\n*   **一致性：** 此次转变旨在让 Zig 标准库的 Windows 实现更具“原则性”，将 NT 内核视为主要目标，而非将其视为一个遗留子系统。\n\n该议题承认，虽然 Native API 在技术上属于“未公开”接口且微软可能会对其进行改动，但其核心功能在过去几十年中一直保持着极高的稳定性。该计划涉及重构 Zig 标准库，利用 `ntdll` 处理内存管理、文件 I/O 和线程调度等核心操作系统任务，仅在需要特定的高级功能时才使用 Win32。这一举措符合 Zig 提供底层控制并避免隐藏抽象的哲学。"
