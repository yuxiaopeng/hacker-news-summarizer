    "url": "https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/",
    "summary": "Seeking a stable alternative to inconsistent powerline adapters, the author explores utilizing the abundant, yet often obsolete, phone sockets found in British homes to achieve gigabit speeds. While UK homes are frequently equipped with multiple phone jacks, they rarely feature internal Ethernet wiring, and modern \"daisy-chained\" phone circuits are notoriously difficult to convert to standard networking.\n\nThe solution was found in the **Gigacopper G4201TM**, a G.hn-based bridge from a German manufacturer designed to run data over two-wire or four-wire copper lines. The author details the logistical challenges of ordering from the EU post-Brexit, including the necessity of manually tracking parcels to pay Royal Mail import fees and the need for BT631A-to-RJ11 adapter cables for UK compatibility.\n\nA key technical takeaway is the distinction between product variants; the author recommends the **\"InHome\" firmware** over the \"Client/Server\" version to ensure lower latency and better peer-to-peer performance. \n\nDespite the house's internal wiring being a chaotic \"maze\" of mismatched Cat5 cables with only a few wires connected, the Gigacopper devices achieved a physical layer connection of approximately 1.7 Gbps. Practical testing via iperf3 confirmed that the setup successfully delivers full gigabit throughput with sub-millisecond latency. The author concludes that for UK residents stuck with messy legacy wiring, these devices offer a \"miracle\" solution for high-speed home networking without the need for invasive rewiring.",

    "chinese_summary": "为了寻求替代连接不稳定的电力猫（Powerline adapter）的方案，作者探索了利用英国住宅中广泛存在但通常已过时的电话插座来实现千兆网速。虽然英国房屋通常配备多个电话插孔，但很少有内部以太网布线，而且现代的“菊花链式”电话电路极难转换为标准网络。\n\n解决方案是 Gigacopper G4201TM，这是一款由德国厂商生产、基于 G.hn 协议的网桥，旨在通过两线或四线铜缆传输数据。作者详细描述了英国脱欧后从欧盟订购面临的物流挑战，包括需要手动追踪包裹以支付皇家邮政的进口费用，以及需要使用 BT631A 转 RJ11 的转接线以适配英国标准。\n\n一个关键的技术心得是不同产品版本之间的区别；作者建议选择“InHome”固件而非“Client/Server”版本，以确保更低的延迟和更好的点对点性能。\n\n尽管房屋内部布线如同“迷宫”般混乱，仅由连接了少数几根芯线且规格不一的五类线组成，但 Gigacopper 设备仍实现了约 1.7 Gbps 的物理层连接。通过 iperf3 进行的实际测试证实，该方案成功实现了满速千兆吞吐量和亚毫秒级延迟。作者总结道，对于受困于杂乱旧布线的英国居民而言，这些设备提供了一种“奇迹般”的高速家庭网络解决方案，且无需进行破坏性的重新布线。"

    "summary": "In \"How I Estimate Work as a Staff Software Engineer,\" the author argues that accurate software estimation is a \"polite fiction.\" Because software development is dominated by unknown research and poorly understood systems rather than predictable tasks, traditional time-based estimates are essentially impossible.\n\nInstead, the author posits that **estimates are political tools** used by management to negotiate and fund projects. In a healthy organization, the process is actually reversed: rather than work defining the time, the desired timeline defines the scope of the work. For example, a \"one-week\" version of a feature will use a vastly different technical approach than a \"six-month\" version.\n\nThe author’s strategy for estimating as a Staff Engineer involves several key shifts:\n\n1.  **Gather Political Context:** Determine what timeframe leadership is already expecting before looking at the code. \n2.  **Reverse-Engineer the Solution:** Instead of asking \"How long will this take?\", ask \"What can I realistically build in the time they want?\"\n3.  **Focus on Unknowns:** Prioritize identifying \"dark forests\" in the codebase where hidden complexity lives.\n4.  **Provide Options, Not Deadlines:** Present managers with a risk assessment and multiple paths (e.g., a \"fast-but-risky\" approach vs. a \"thorough-but-long\" approach) rather than a single, flat date.\n\nUltimately, the author suggests that engineers should stop viewing estimation as a mathematical burden and start viewing it as a way to provide **technical clarity**. By offering pragmatic trade-offs and working within business constraints, engineers build the trust necessary to push back when a project is truly impossible.",
