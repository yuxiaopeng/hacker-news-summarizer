    "summary": "Mitchell Hashimoto announces the upcoming release of `libghostty`, an embeddable library providing terminal emulation functionality for various applications. The initial component, `libghostty-vt`, is a zero-dependency library (not even libc) for parsing terminal sequences and managing terminal state, extracted from Ghostty's core. It aims to address the pervasive problem of ad-hoc, incomplete, and buggy terminal emulation implementations found in numerous programs like terminal emulators, multiplexers, editors, and web applications.\n\n`libghostty-vt` offers advantages like SIMD-optimized parsing, excellent Unicode support, optimized memory usage, and compatibility with features like Kitty Graphics Protocol and Tmux Control Mode. It will initially support macOS and Linux (x86_64 and aarch64) with plans to expand to Windows, embedded devices, and the web via WASM.\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of a stable and reusable solution for terminal emulation, as it's often not a core business concern. Future `libghostty` components will include input handling, GPU rendering, GTK widgets, and Swift frameworks. A Zig module for `libghostty-vt` is available for testing, with a C API coming soon. The project is in an alpha stage and seeks feedback from developers to refine the API. The goal is to ship a tagged version within six months, contingent on readiness. The author believes `libghostty` will have a greater impact than Ghostty the application itself, contributing to a more feature-rich and stable Ghostty as well.\n",

    "url": "https://verialabs.com/blog/from-mcp-to-shell/",
    "summary": "Veria Labs discovered a critical vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation of several AI tools, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE). The flaw stemmed from MCP clients trusting authorization URLs provided by MCP servers without proper validation.\n\nThe vulnerability was first identified in Cloudflare's `use-mcp` library, where an attacker-controlled MCP server could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the client's browser via a `javascript:` URL passed to `window.open()`. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover.\n\nThe vulnerability was then escalated to RCE in Anthropic's MCP Inspector. By stealing the Inspector Proxy's authentication token via XSS, attackers could instruct the proxy to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine.\n\nSimilarly, Claude Code and Gemini CLI were found vulnerable due to command injection flaws when opening the authorization URL on Windows. The article detailed specific payloads used to achieve RCE in these applications.\n\nWhile ChatGPT's MCP implementation was also vulnerable, its Content Security Policy (CSP) prevented exploitation.\n\nCloudflare, Anthropic, and Google implemented fixes ranging from URL sanitization to complete removal of shell usage. Anthropic's update to the MCP TypeScript SDK, which blacklisted dangerous URI schemes, had the most significant impact, improving security across the entire MCP ecosystem.\n\nThe researchers thanked Cloudflare, Anthropic, and Google for their swift responses and patching processes and shared proof-of-concept code on GitHub.\n",

It differentiates between \"being strategic\" and \"being seen as strategic,\" highlighting the frustration of those who quietly execute effective strategies but are overlooked.\n\nThe author emphasizes that strategy is contextual and must adapt to changing environments, like the shift from the ZIRP era to a more resource-constrained one. They outline different strategies needed: product, technical, team, and personal, recognizing that they interact in a complex, often unbalanced way.\n\nThe article introduces the concept of \"proximate objectives\" as incremental steps towards the overall strategy, crucial for execution and demonstrable progress. It argues that undervaluing the implementation of these objectives leads to a misperception of who is truly strategic.\n\nFour elements are identified as essential for effective strategy: time, context, direction, and expertise. The author illustrates the dangers of over-emphasizing each in isolation.\n\nFinally, the article breaks down how each strategy – product, technical, team, and personal – plays a role: product strategy sets the direction, technical strategy evolves the context, team strategy focuses on execution, and the personal strategy necessitates carving out time for strategic thinking amidst daily demands. The core message is that effective strategy requires balancing these elements to navigate the path forward, both for the team and the individual.\n",

    "url": "https://justinpombrio.net/2025/09/22/imagining-a-language-without-booleans.html",
    "summary": "Justin Pombrio's blog post explores the idea of a programming language that eliminates booleans, replacing them with `Option` or `Result` types. He starts by observing how `if` statements behave differently when they have an `else` clause versus when they don't. He proposes that an `if` statement without an `else` can return an `Option<T>`, where `Some(value)` is returned if the condition is true, and `None` if false. This extends to `else` as well, where `else` provides a default value for an `Option`.\n\nThe author then extends this concept to logical operators `and` and `or`, making them operate on `Option` types as well. He notes the equivalence between booleans and `Option<()>`, suggesting that booleans can be entirely replaced with options. He then goes further, leveraging the equivalence between `Option<T>` and `Result<T, ()>`, proposing a new syntax `T ? E` to represent `Result<T, E>`. He defines aliases: `bool = nil?nil`, `true = Ok(nil)`, and `false = Err(nil)`.\n\nPombrio explores the type and evaluation rules for `if`, `else`, `and`, `or`, and `not` within this system. He demonstrates that constructs like `else if` and a \"try/else\" pattern for loops can be naturally expressed. He uses real-world code snippets from his projects to illustrate how the proposed language can simplify code by eliminating the need for explicitly wrapping results in `Some` or `Err`, and for early return statements. The author concludes that this design seems coherent and may influence his thinking about conditionals, seeking similar ideas to those he has presented.\n",
    "chinese_title": "想象一个没有布尔值的语言",
    "chinese_summary": "Justin Pombrio的博文探讨了一种编程语言的设计理念，该语言消除了布尔值，并用`Option`或`Result`类型取而代之。 他首先观察到`if`语句在有`else`子句和没有`else`子句时的不同行为。他提出，没有`else`的`if`语句可以返回一个`Option<T>`，如果条件为真，则返回`Some(value)`，如果为假，则返回`None`。 这同样适用于`else`，其中`else`为`Option`提供一个默认值。\n\n然后，作者将这个概念扩展到逻辑运算符`and`和`or`，使它们也能在`Option`类型上操作。他注意到布尔值和`Option<()>`之间的等价性，暗示布尔值可以完全被Option取代。 他更进一步，利用`Option<T>`和`Result<T, ()>`之间的等价性，提出了一种新的语法`T ? E`来表示`Result<T, E>`。他定义了别名：`bool = nil?nil`，`true = Ok(nil)`，以及`false = Err(nil)`。\n\nPombrio探讨了此系统中`if`、`else`、`and`、`or`和`not`的类型和求值规则。他证明了像`else if`和循环的“try/else”模式等结构都可以自然地表达。 他使用来自其项目的真实代码片段来说明所提出的语言如何通过消除显式地将结果包装在`Some`或`Err`中以及提前返回语句的需求来简化代码。 作者的结论是，这种设计看起来是连贯的，并且可能会影响他对条件语句的思考，寻找与他提出的想法类似的想法。"

    "summary": "This article discusses how zoning laws and occupancy restrictions have effectively eliminated low-cost housing options like single-room occupancies (SROs) and hindered house sharing among unrelated individuals. It cites a Pew report highlighting the decline of SROs from a significant portion of the rental market to near extinction due to restrictive zoning and building codes enacted from the mid-1950s onward. These changes, often driven by negative perceptions of SROs and their residents, have contributed to a rise in homelessness.\n\nThe author emphasizes the simple solution of allowing unrelated individuals to share housing without arbitrary limits, pointing out that current laws often prevent roommates from living together and utilizing unused bedrooms, despite it being a financially beneficial option for both landlords and tenants. Iowa, Oregon, and Colorado are mentioned as examples of states that have passed legislation to overturn local codes prohibiting house sharing. The article concludes that many societal problems are a result of excessive regulation that restricts property owners' ability to utilize their assets in ways that could alleviate housing shortages and affordability issues.\n",

This allows for dynamic adjustment of server weights without directly altering the configuration.\n*   **Weight Adjustment:**  Servers gradually increase their `effective_weight` up to their configured `weight`, providing a smoother transition during weight changes.\n*   **`ngx_http_upstream_get_peer` Modification:**  The core logic for selecting a peer is rewritten to prioritize servers with higher `current_weight` while considering factors like server health (max fails, fail timeout) and already tried servers.  It now returns a pointer to the peer structure instead of just an index.\n*   **Avoiding Stale Servers:** Considers 'down' status, `max_fails`, and `fail_timeout` to prevent selecting unhealthy servers.\n*   **Improved Selection Logic:**  The selection process now ensures that even if a server has a lower configured weight, it has a chance to be selected, preventing starvation of low-weight servers.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** Adjusts `effective_weight` down on errors to reduce the selection probability of unhealthy servers.\n\nIn essence, this patch aims to improve the standard round-robin algorithm by adding a smoother and more dynamic way to distribute traffic across upstream servers, taking into account server health and preventing traffic imbalances.\n",

Faced with financial struggles after losing a major sponsorship due to platforming DHH, Ruby Central became heavily reliant on Shopify. Shopify, in turn, reportedly pressured Ruby Central to take full control of the RubyGems GitHub repositories and gems, threatening to withdraw funding if they didn't comply.\n\nThe takeover involved downgrading existing maintainer permissions, ultimately removing them and replacing them with a Shopify-backed on-call rotation. A key point of contention is that while Ruby Central operates the RubyGems Service (the servers running the RubyGems code), they do not own the RubyGems source code, repositories, or gems themselves, which have historically been community-maintained.\n\nThe article claims the Ruby Central board was aware of the potential damage the takeover would cause but proceeded anyway, under immense pressure from Shopify. Specific allegations include the exclusion of long-time RubyGems maintainer André Arko, misrepresentation of the situation by Ruby Central board members, and the use of \"supply chain security\" as a cover for the power grab. The author concludes that the takeover was driven by Shopify's desire for control, not genuine security concerns, and that Ruby Central capitulated due to financial dependence.\n",

    "summary": "This paper, \"Are Elites Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking? Evidence from MBA Students,\" investigates the fairness and efficiency preferences of future elites – Ivy League MBA students – and how these preferences relate to redistributive policies. The authors, Marcel Preuss, Germán Reyes, Jason Somerville, and Joy Wu, use an incentivized lab experiment to study these preferences.\n\nThe key findings reveal that MBA students implement significantly more unequal earnings distributions than the average American, irrespective of whether the inequality arises from luck or merit. Their redistributive choices are also highly sensitive to the efficiency costs associated with redistribution, with this effect being much stronger than what is observed in representative U.S. samples. Furthermore, the study found that MBA students are less likely to strictly adhere to meritocratic principles compared to the broader population.\n\nThe authors conclude that these findings offer new insights into how the redistributive preferences of elites could contribute to high levels of inequality in the United States. The paper contributes to the understanding of the preferences of future policymakers and their potential impact on economic inequality.

    "summary": "This article explores using LLM agents to enhance search experiences, contrasting them with traditional RAG systems. The author argues that complex \"thick\" search APIs can be counterproductive for agents, hindering their ability to reason effectively. Instead, a simpler, \"stupid\" search backend that relies on basic keyword matching, combined with clear documentation for the agent, can yield surprisingly good results.\n\nThe agent's reasoning capabilities allow it to iteratively refine queries, build a \"mental model\" of the search tool, and ultimately find more relevant results. The author emphasizes the importance of tracking and evaluating past queries, allowing the agent to learn from its experiences and improve future searches. Semantic caching further enhances this learning by leveraging similar past queries.\n\nHowever, the author cautions that an agent's judgment is limited and disjoint from user preferences. The lack of user clickstream feedback presents a significant gap, as agents may not understand the complex and often unpredictable behavior of users. There's a risk that an agent's reasoning might lead it to discard relevant results that would be engaging to users, highlighting a potential conflict between explicit reasoning and implicit user expectations. Despite these caveats, the author concludes that using LLM agents for search is a promising and enjoyable area to explore, offering a unique approach to building more intelligent and personalized search experiences.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses the \"thundering herd\" problem, a common issue when caching data to reduce database load. The problem arises when multiple concurrent requests for the same missing cache entry all query the database simultaneously, overwhelming it.\n\nThe author demonstrates the problem with a Spring Boot application using Redis for caching and a Postgres database. The code follows a cache-aside pattern, but concurrent requests for the same ID result in multiple database lookups.\n\nTwo solutions are presented:\n\n1.  **Distributed Lock (Redis):** Uses Redis to acquire a lock for each cache key. Only the request that acquires the lock fetches the data from the database and backfills the cache. Other requests retry from the cache. This is suitable for multi-node setups, ensuring only one database call despite requests spread across nodes, but introduces network overhead.\n\n2.  **In-Process Synchronization (Java):** Uses a `CompletableFuture` and `ConcurrentHashMap` to synchronize requests within a single JVM. When a cache miss occurs, a `CompletableFuture` is created (or an existing one retrieved). Only the request that creates the future performs the database lookup and backfills the cache. Other requests await the future's completion. This avoids network calls but doesn't coordinate across multiple nodes, potentially leading to multiple database lookups in a multi-node environment.\n\nThe author concludes that while caching is useful, it can introduce problems like the thundering herd, emphasizing the importance of considering edge cases and choosing the appropriate solution based on the application's needs.\n",

    "summary": "Dayvi Schuster argues that Zig is more practical than Rust for real-world CLI tools due to its simpler approach to memory management and developer ergonomics. The article contrasts Rust's borrow checker, which enforces strict memory safety rules at compile time, with Zig's manual memory management using allocators and the `defer` statement.\n\nSchuster contends that while Rust's borrow checker prevents certain memory safety errors, it can introduce cognitive overhead, boilerplate code, and limitations that hinder developer productivity, especially for smaller projects like CLI tools. The borrow checker only catches issues at compile time, but it will not fix underlying issues of developers misunderstanding memory lifetimes or overcomplicated ownership.\n\nThe author emphasizes that memory safety is just one aspect of overall software safety, highlighting the importance of predictable behavior, error handling, performance, data security, and robustness against attacks. While Rust excels at memory safety, Zig allows developers to achieve similar levels of safety with a basic understanding of memory management and discipline, resulting in more straightforward and easier-to-reason-about code.\n\nZig's manual memory management, combined with features like `comptime` and well-designed allocators, provides a balance between control and safety, making it a compelling choice for CLI tool development.

    "chinese_summary": "Dayvi Schuster 认为，由于 Zig 在内存管理和开发者人体工程学方面的方法更简单，因此对于实际的 CLI 工具来说，Zig 比 Rust 更实用。 文章对比了 Rust 的借用检查器（在编译时强制执行严格的内存安全规则）和 Zig 使用分配器和 `defer` 语句进行的手动内存管理。\n\nSchuster 认为，虽然 Rust 的借用检查器可以防止某些内存安全错误，但它会引入认知负担、样板代码和限制，从而阻碍开发人员的生产力，尤其是在像 CLI 工具这样的小型项目中。 借用检查器仅在编译时捕获问题，但它不会修复开发人员误解内存生命周期或过度复杂的所有权等根本问题。\n\n作者强调，内存安全只是整体软件安全的一个方面，并强调了可预测的行为、错误处理、性能、数据安全以及针对攻击的鲁棒性的重要性。 虽然 Rust 在内存安全方面表现出色，但 Zig 允许开发人员通过对内存管理和规范的基本理解来实现类似的安全级别，从而产生更直接且更易于推理的代码。\n\nZig 的手动内存管理与 `comptime` 和精心设计的分配器等功能相结合，在控制和安全之间实现了平衡，使其成为 CLI 工具开发的引人注目的选择。 作者最后总结说，虽然 Rust 适用于大型、复杂的项目，其中编译时保证至关重要，但 Zig 的简单性和开发者人体工程学使其成为更小、更日常的 CLI 工具的更实用选择。"

Jim claims that Altoids completely mask the taste and that this practice has revolutionized his productivity.\n\nThe narrator is disgusted but begins to reflect on the \"cat turds\" in his own life - the tedious, pointless, and frustrating aspects of his software engineering job. He struggles with a YAML template problem and realizes that he no longer finds intellectual satisfaction in solving these kinds of issues. He acknowledges that he used to be passionate about programming but has grown jaded by the pointless nature of many of his tasks.\n\nAs he walks home, the narrator expands his definition of \"cat turds\" to include various unpleasant tasks and bureaucratic hoops he's had to jump through throughout his life, such as homework assignments and college admission essays. He recognizes that he has been \"eating cat turds\" for a long time, and he feels trapped in a cycle of doing work that is ultimately meaningless and unsatisfying.

    "summary": "A new study from UC Irvine reveals that common indoor surfaces like wood, concrete, and painted walls act as significant \"chemical sponges\" for harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs, stemming from sources like insecticides, cigarette smoke, wildfire smoke, and everyday household products, can linger on surfaces for up to a year, posing a long-term health risk through inhalation or skin contact.\n\nResearchers, through controlled experiments in a simulated home environment, discovered that these porous materials absorb and hold VOCs to a far greater extent than previously understood, surpassing the absorption capacity of thin organic films. This explains why odors and contaminants persist indoors even after the source is removed, such as the lingering smell of \"thirdhand smoke.\"\n\nThe study highlights the limitations of ventilation alone in removing these contaminants, emphasizing the need for physical cleaning methods like vacuuming, mopping, and dusting to effectively eliminate VOCs from surface reservoirs. This new understanding of how VOCs interact with indoor environments has significant implications for public health, suggesting that individuals can be exposed to harmful chemicals long after initial introduction, and underscores the importance of comprehensive cleaning practices to mitigate exposure risks.\n",

    "url": "https://danieljharvey.github.io/posts/2023-02-08-llvm-compiler-part-1.html",
    "summary": "This article documents the initial steps in compiling a small functional language called \"mimsa\" to LLVM. The author aims to gradually add features, including a typechecker, while introducing more LLVM concepts. The starting point is a simple calculator language that supports integer arithmetic with addition, subtraction, and multiplication.\n\nThe language's abstract syntax tree (AST) is defined using Haskell datatypes (Expr and Op). The article covers parsing text into these ASTs using the megaparsec library, emphasizing features like lexemes for whitespace handling and the Operator type for parsing infix expressions with correct precedence.\n\nBefore delving into LLVM, a simple interpreter for the language is presented. The core of the article then focuses on compiling the calculator language to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) using the `llvm-hs-pure` and `llvm-hs-pretty` libraries. It explains the structure of LLVM modules, including declaring external functions (like `printint` from a simple C runtime) and defining the `main` function.  Haskell code snippets illustrate how to convert language expressions into LLVM instructions (e.g., `primToLLVM` and `exprToLLVM`). The generated LLVM code is shown, demonstrating the translation of arithmetic operations. The article concludes with instructions on compiling the generated LLVM IR using clang and running the resulting executable. The goal is to build a solid foundation for adding more complex functional programming features in future iterations.\n",

    "url": "https://antithesis.com/blog/2025/compiler_bug/",
    "summary": "This article details the discovery of a C++ compiler bug in Clang, triggered by a specific combination of obscure language features within the Antithesis SDK. The Antithesis SDK allows developers to add assertions to their code for automated testing and fault injection.\n\nThe challenge was to implement assertions like `REACHABLE()` which need to be registered even if the code is never executed. The solution involved a clever C++ construct: a static `Assertion` object within a templated `CatalogEntry` struct. This ensures a \"catalog\" of assertions is emitted at startup.\n\nTo allow multiple assertions, the `CatalogEntry` was templatized using non-type template parameters, specifically strings (character arrays) containing the assertion message, filename, and line number. This allows a unique `CatalogEntry` for each assertion. To reduce executable size, these template classes were placed within anonymous namespaces.\n\nThe bug arose when the same assertion message was used in different files. A new optimization pipeline in Clang 17 incorrectly deduplicated symbols related to the fixed-size strings used as template parameters. This led to a compilation error as the compiler couldn't find the required symbol in the second file.\n\nThe author highlights the rare combination of features - optimization, non-type templates with character arrays, and anonymous namespaces - needed to trigger the bug. The lesson is that complex bugs often arise from the interaction of multiple rare or obscure features within a system. While a bug report has been filed, a practical workaround for users is to avoid reusing the same assertion message across different files.\n",

He also mentions a website owner blocking Iranian IPs due to the regime's support of Russia's war in Ukraine, though the author clarifies that this doesn't reflect the views of most Iranians.

However, he advocates for empathy and thoughtful consideration when implementing such restrictions, recognizing the real people affected. He stresses that the actions of the Iranian government do not represent the Iranian people, who are often the first victims of the regime.\n\nHe concludes by clarifying that he is not asking for the removal of sanctions, but simply sharing his experiences and expressing his opposition to the Iranian regime. He advocates for a more nuanced approach to restrictions, suggesting the use of the \"451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons\" error code as a more transparent alternative to a generic \"403 Forbidden.\"\n",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is facing backlash for using Pokémon imagery and music to promote ICE deportation raids on social media. The DHS video featured dramatic raid footage spliced with Pokémon-style animation and used the Pokémon theme song. They also shared mocked-up Pokémon \"cards\" showcasing individuals arrested and deported, highlighting their alleged crimes. These cards included the phrase \"Gotta Catch 'Em All\" and listed \"ice\" as a weakness.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) further participated by posting a GIF of Pikachu dancing. The use of Pokémon IP without apparent permission has prompted questions to Nintendo, the Pokémon Company, and DHS about awareness and approval. Critics have accused DHS of using taxpayer money for \"ICE propaganda.\"\n\nOne specific raid featured in the video, showing a door being blown in, is under scrutiny due to a related legal issue involving Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, dubbed \"ICE Barbie,\" as U.S. citizens were allegedly handcuffed without a warrant during the raid. This media push is part of a larger DHS campaign aimed at bolstering Noem's image after previous criticism and damaging headlines, involving substantial spending handled by a GOP-linked firm.\n\nThe DHS and the Trump administration have faced similar issues in the past for using copyrighted material without permission, including using audio from a Jet2 ad and music from Jess Glynne, Warner Bros., and The Rolling Stones.\n",

Developers are heavily relying on AI for software development, with a median usage of two hours daily, resulting in significant productivity gains (over 80% of respondents) and improved code quality (59%).\n\nHowever, a \"trust paradox\" exists, as a significant portion of developers, while finding AI useful, don't fully trust it. AI primarily serves as a supportive tool, enhancing productivity rather than replacing human judgment. While AI boosts individual performance, its organizational impact is more complex. AI adoption correlates with higher software delivery throughput, but ensuring quality before delivery remains a challenge.\n\nThe report identifies seven team archetypes to provide a deeper understanding of factors driving success in AI adoption, ranging from \"Harmonious high-achievers\" to teams stuck in a \"Legacy bottleneck.\" It emphasizes that simply adopting AI isn't enough.

    "summary": "Researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology have discovered a link between oral bacteria in the gut and the development of Parkinson's disease. The study, published in *Nature Communications*, identified *Streptococcus mutans*, a bacterium commonly associated with dental caries, as being more prevalent in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's patients.\n\nThe researchers found that *S. mutans* produces urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), which were found in elevated levels in the gut and blood of Parkinson's patients. ImP can enter the bloodstream, reach the brain, and contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of Parkinson's.\n\nExperiments using mouse models showed that introducing *S. mutans* into the gut led to increased ImP levels in the blood and brain, resulting in Parkinson's-like symptoms including loss of dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, impaired motor function, and aggregation of alpha-synuclein.\n\nThe study also found that these effects are dependent on the activation of the mTORC1 signaling protein complex. Inhibiting mTORC1 reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction in the mice. These findings suggest that targeting the oral-gut microbiome and its metabolites could be a novel therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease. Professor Ara Koh stated the research provides a \"mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease.\"\n",

    "summary": "This arXiv article (arXiv:2403.07492v2) introduces a new error metric called \"Hyb Error,\" proposed by Peichen Xie, designed for numerical analysis. Hyb Error is defined as `|x-y|/(1+|y|)`, where `x` is an approximation of `y`.\n\nThe core idea behind Hyb Error is to combine the strengths of both absolute and relative errors while mitigating their weaknesses. It achieves this by being equivalent to half the harmonic mean of absolute and relative errors. Specifically, when `|y|` approaches 0, Hyb Error behaves like absolute error, avoiding the problem of exaggerated relative error for very small true values. Conversely, when `|y|` approaches infinity, it behaves like relative error, preventing absolute error from being inflated for very large true values.\n\nThe paper highlights the equivalence of an Hyb Error of epsilon (`ε`) to the expression `|x-y| = ε + ε|y|`. This equivalence is crucial because it directly relates to the common floating-point equality check function \"isclose,\" where `isclose(x, y, ε, ε) == True` implies that the Hyb Error between `x` and `y` is less than or equal to `ε`.\n\nFurthermore, the paper introduces the Maximum Element-wise Hyb Error (MEHE) for sequences, arguing that it is a pragmatic metric for reflecting the most significant error in a sequence and corresponds directly to the decision boundary of the \"isclose\" function.\n",

The author encodes gamebooks as directed graphs, where sections are nodes and choices are edges, allowing the use of network algorithms to extract information like shortest paths to death or paths with the most fights.\n\nThe analysis reveals several interesting facts about the Lone Wolf series.  \"The Masters of Darkness\" has the most action, while \"The Kingdoms of Terror\" offers the quickest route to death. \"The Caverns of Kalte\" is the most lethal overall.  Over the series, the data suggests the books may have become less punishing, focusing more on adventure and story.\n\nThe author uses Python libraries `graphviz` and `networkx` for visualization and path processing.  The article discusses challenges like cycles (circular paths) in some books, which require removal for certain algorithms, and disconnected graphs representing puzzles within the gamebooks. Cycle removal is flagged as an NP-complete problem, though manageable due to the relatively small size of gamebook graphs.\n\nUltimately, while the analysis didn't yield groundbreaking insights, it proved a worthwhile exercise in applying graph theory to a unique domain.

    "url": "https://blog.lenot.re/a/smp",
    "summary": "This article details the implementation of Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP) in the Maestro operating system, focusing on how it enables the use of multiple CPU cores to improve performance. The process begins with enumerating CPU cores using ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface), a controversial standard described and criticised by Linus Torvalds and others for its complexity and potential anti-competitive intent from Microsoft. The MADT table within ACPI provides information about processor cores and their Local APIC IDs.\n\nThe article explains the transition from the legacy PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller) to the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) for interrupt handling, including xAPIC and x2APIC. A crucial aspect is calibrating the APIC timer by comparing it to the HPET (High Precision Event Timer) to determine its frequency.\n\nBooting additional CPU cores involves sending Inter-Processor Interrupts (IPIs) with specific delays, followed by initialization to switch them to protected or long mode. The article addresses the need for a global halt mechanism, per-CPU structures (accessed via the gs segment register), and TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) shootdown to maintain cache consistency across cores.\n\nDeferred calls facilitate communication between cores, using MPSC queues and IPIs. The scheduler is rewritten to manage multiple cores, with each core having its own run queue. Process load balancing, inspired by FreeBSD's ULE scheduler, aims to distribute processes efficiently across cores based on priority, topology, and idle status. A kernel thread periodically rebalances processes to optimize CPU utilization.\n",

    "summary": "This article argues that germicidal ultraviolet (UV) light, specifically far-UVC light, has the potential to drastically reduce airborne disease transmission, similar to how water filtration and chlorination eradicated waterborne illnesses like typhoid.\n\nThe article highlights the history of using UV light for disinfection, noting early successes and subsequent decline due to concerns about skin and eye irritation and the rise of antibiotics. However, it emphasizes that modern far-UVC technology, using wavelengths under 230 nanometers, is harmless to humans while remaining effective at disabling pathogens.\n\nFar-UVC works by damaging the DNA/RNA of airborne viruses and bacteria, preventing replication. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing airborne pathogen levels in enclosed spaces, even against resistant viruses. The article contrasts far-UVC with alternative air-cleaning methods like ventilation and filtration, acknowledging their roles but pointing out their limitations, such as energy consumption, cost, and potential for introducing pollutants or requiring temperature adjustments. While far-UVC systems can be more expensive than filtration, the article suggests that costs are decreasing. The authors advocate for wider adoption of far-UVC technology to create safer indoor environments and combat the spread of airborne diseases, potentially making them as rare as waterborne illnesses.\n",

The author argues that Apple's slow adoption of new web features, coupled with its control over browser engines on iOS, hinders web platform progress.\n\nThe author presents data showing that Safari lags behind Chromium and Gecko in feature implementation, often shipping features years after other browsers. This delay, they argue, isn't due to constructive redesign efforts, but rather a pattern of catching up without offering alternative solutions.\n\nThe article then dives into specific cases like Web MIDI, Web USB, and Web Bluetooth, all of which were designed with privacy and security considerations. The author claims that Apple has consistently objected to these APIs, often without providing substantive analysis, constructive feedback, or alternative proposals, despite years of open development and requests for collaboration. They argue that Apple's objections often come after years of silence and that they have actively ignored requests from developers in order to come up with an alternative, or even share their viewpoint on an API.\n\nThe author concludes that Apple's behavior stifles web innovation, particularly on iOS, where developers are forced to rely on WebKit's capabilities.

The author acknowledges DSA's relevance in job interviews but criticizes the practice of asking candidates to memorize solutions to DSA problems, as it doesn't accurately reflect real-world problem-solving skills.\n\nThe author emphasizes a practical understanding of fundamental data structures like linked lists, arrays, hash tables, and trees, focusing on their functionality and trade-offs. Instead of memorizing sorting algorithms or focusing on obscure, quiz-like DSA problems, new engineers should focus on understanding how data organization impacts algorithm efficiency (time complexity).\n\nThe article advocates for prioritizing testing skills over deep DSA knowledge. Testing is presented as a constantly used, real-world skill that demonstrates a commitment to high-quality software.

    "summary": "This article introduces `httpjail`, a tool designed to enhance the security and governance of AI coding agents like Claude by implementing fine-grained HTTP filtering. The core problem is the lack of security tooling as AI agents gain power, leading to potential risks like destructive actions, data leaks, and unauthorized operations.\n\n`httpjail` acts as an HTTP(S) interceptor with process-level network isolation. It defaults to denying all non-HTTP(S) traffic, while allowing DNS. Rules for filtering can be defined using JavaScript expressions or shell scripts, offering flexibility beyond traditional firewalls. Examples include blocking all but LLM API traffic, allowing only GET requests, or whitelisting specific hosts.\n\nThe tool operates in two modes: a strong mode (Linux-only, using namespaces and `nftables`) and a weak mode (macOS, relying on the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable). It performs TLS interception to inspect HTTPS traffic, dynamically generating certificates signed by a local CA that needs to be trusted by client applications.\n\nThe article also discusses potential jail escapes, particularly in the weak mode, and proposes using Docker for combined filesystem and network isolation. For maximum security, a server mode allows running `httpjail` on a dedicated server, with network firewall rules restricting traffic to the proxy. This forces all or only approved API requests through the proxy server. Finally, the article provides instructions on how to try out `httpjail`.\n",

    "summary": "This article delves into the origins and impact of the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book series. The author reflects on his personal experience with the first book, \"The Cave of Time,\" and how it sparked his imagination and interest in interactive media, ultimately influencing his career as the Digital Antiquarian.\n\nThe article highlights the series' immense popularity and influence, positioning it as a \"gateway drug\" to interactive entertainment, leading readers towards tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons and eventually computer games.\n\nBeyond the authors Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery, the article credits Amy Berkower, a literary agent at Writers House, as a crucial figure in the series' success. She recognized the potential of Ray Montgomery's (co-owner of Vermont Crossroads) \"Adventures of You\" concept. Montgomery, in turn, had been approached by Packard, who had previously struggled to publish his interactive book, \"Sugarcane Island.\" Packard's inspiration came from creating interactive bedtime stories for his daughters.\n\nThe article details Packard's initial rejections, with publishers citing concerns about making reading harder for children with multiple choices. Ultimately, Vermont Crossroads took a chance on Packard's concept, paving the way for the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" phenomenon. The series' success highlights the power of editors and agents in shaping cultural trends, often working behind the scenes.\n",
