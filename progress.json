    "url": "https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/07/nist-ion-clock-sets-new-record-most-accurate-clock-world",
    "summary": "NIST researchers have developed the most accurate atomic clock to date, an aluminum ion-based \"quantum logic clock,\" achieving timekeeping accuracy to 19 decimal places. This breakthrough significantly improves upon previous records, boasting 41% greater accuracy and 2.6 times more stability than any other ion clock.\n\nThe clock's enhanced accuracy stems from 20 years of continuous development and improvements across all its components. The key innovation is the \"buddy system\" of pairing an aluminum ion (for its steady ticking) with a magnesium ion (for laser cooling and state readout). The team addressed challenges like excess micromotion of the ions by redesigning the ion trap with a thicker diamond wafer and improved gold coatings, and reduced hydrogen interference by rebuilding the vacuum chamber with titanium.\n\nFurther enhancing stability, the team collaborated with Jun Ye at JILA to utilize an ultrastable laser via fiber links, reducing quantum fluctuations. This allowed the team to probe the ions for a full second, drastically cutting down the averaging time needed to reach the 19th decimal place from weeks to a day and a half.\n\nThis record-breaking accuracy contributes to the international effort to redefine the second and opens doors for advancements in quantum physics, quantum technology, geodesy, and exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as investigating the constancy of fundamental constants. Researchers plan to further enhance the clock's capabilities by scaling up the number of ions and entangling them.\n",

    "url": "https://www.matthieulc.com/posts/shoggoth-mini",
    "summary": "Shoggoth Mini is a soft tentacle robot project exploring expressiveness in robots beyond utilitarian functionality. The creator, Matthieu B. Le Cauchois, was inspired by Apple's ELEGNT paper and SpiRobs, aiming to imbue the robot with a sense of aliveness through motion.\n\nThe project involved hardware design, starting with a simple base and evolving into a dome-shaped head with stereo cameras (\"eyes\"). Cable tangling issues were resolved with spool covers, and a calibration script improved tension control. The spine was thickened to prevent sagging.\n\nControl is achieved through a two-layered system: low-level control using both open-loop primitives and closed-loop reinforcement learning (RL) policies (like finger tracking), and high-level control using GPT-4o's real-time API which streams audio and text. Vision events are processed to provide GPT-4o cues. A 2D projection was key to simplifying both manual and automated control, mapping trackpad movements to tendon lengths.\n\nPerception relies on MediaPipe for hand tracking and a YOLO model trained on a custom dataset for tentacle tip tracking. RL, specifically PPO, was used to train the robot to follow a user's finger. Sim-to-real transfer was improved with dynamics randomization and a constrained action space.\n\nThe author observed that predictability reduced the feeling of aliveness. Future directions include giving the robot a voice, expanding its expressive repertoire, adding more tentacles, and using direct drive motors. The project's code and 3D printing files are available on GitHub.\n",

    "url": "https://tomrenner.com/posts/llm-inevitabilism/",
    "summary": "This article argues against the \"inevitabilism\" surrounding the rise of large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence. The author defines inevitabilism as the framing of a particular future as inevitable, thereby limiting the scope of discussion to adaptation rather than questioning the desirability of that future.\n\nDrawing a parallel to debate tactics, the author explains how framing an argument is crucial to controlling the conversation. They cite examples of tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Ng, and Ginni Rometty using inevitabilist language to push the idea that AI is not something to be questioned, but something to be embraced and adapted to. These statements often carry an implicit threat, suggesting that those who resist will be left behind.\n\nThe author critiques this framing, arguing that it stifles critical discussion about the kind of future we want to create. They contend that we do have a choice in how we develop and utilize technology, and that succumbing to the narrative of inevitability surrenders that agency.\n\nUltimately, the article is a call to action, urging readers to resist the allure of inevitabilism, envision the future they desire, and actively fight for it, rather than passively accepting a future dictated by technological determinism. The author specifically targets the narrative surrounding LLMs and their role in shaping the future, suggesting that we should critically evaluate their potential impact and make conscious choices about their integration into society.\n",

    "summary": "This article details the implementation of unbounded, captureless lookbehinds in the Rust's official `regex` crate, a significant upgrade from many existing regex engines. It highlights the architecture of the `regex`, `regex-automata`, and `regex-syntax` crates involved. The core work involved creating \"WriteLookAround\" and \"CheckLookAround\" NFA state types and integrating them into the PikeVM engine.\n\nChallenges included ensuring the meta-engine only used PikeVM for regexes with lookbehinds, prioritizing deeply nested lookbehind threads, and addressing performance bottlenecks discovered through benchmarking. Initially, lookbehind sub-automata were prioritized too highly, causing unnecessary full haystack scans. This was resolved by separating lookbehind threads from the main regex threads.\n\nAnother performance issue arose with match-all searches, where lookbehind threads were discarded between matches, leading to quadratic runtime complexity. This was fixed by preserving and restoring lookbehind threads between iterations.\n\nThe implementation includes unit and integration tests to ensure correctness and maintain linear runtime complexity. This enhancement makes the Rust `regex` crate more powerful and versatile, while preserving its performance characteristics.\n",

    "summary": "This article encourages programmers to mentally \"sketch proofs\" while coding to improve speed and accuracy. This involves reasoning about code on the fly, a skill that develops with practice. The author provides several examples of reasoning techniques, including:\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** Identifying parts of the code that only move forward (like checkpointing or LSM trees) to rule out many possible outcomes. Immutability is described as a cousin of monotonicity.\n\n*   **Pre- and Post-conditions:** Defining what's assumed to be true before and after a function runs. This aids reasoning and helps generate unit tests.\n\n*   **Invariants:** Identifying things that should always be true during code execution, ensuring consistency.\n\n*   **Isolation:** Limiting the \"blast radius\" of code changes by identifying \"firewalls\" that prevent unintended propagation. This helps prove that unchanged behaviors remain unaffected.\n\n*   **Induction:** Applying inductive reasoning to recursive functions and data structures (like trees and lists) to prove correctness. It involves proving a base case and demonstrating that if a condition holds for `n`, it also holds for `n+1`.\n\nBy consciously applying these techniques, programmers can increase their confidence in code correctness, reducing debugging time and improving overall efficiency. The key is to develop the habit of reasoning about code properties as it's being written.\n",

The goal is to enable MLX to leverage NVIDIA GPUs for both local development (on Macs) and deployment on high-performance computing systems. The primary author, zcbenz, is working on this feature with sponsorship from Apple.\n\nThe initial pull request introduces the basic CUDA infrastructure, allowing a simple tutorial example to run.  Developers express interest in adding ROCm (AMD GPU) support as well.  Discussion focuses on how to best integrate the CUDA backend into MLX, with a preference for merging incremental PRs for easier maintenance and testing through CI.\n\nThe author shares details about the challenges of porting kernels to CUDA, specifically regarding passing shape/strides and optimizing kernel performance. Significant performance improvements are achieved by switching to `cudaEvent` for event handling, reducing prefetch calls, and temporarily delaying the destruction of operands and temporaries (though this last optimization raises concerns about memory usage for large graphs and is marked for further configuration).\n\nThe performance analysis shows overheads in kernel launching and synchronization, which are addressed through several optimizations. The logistic regression example runs successfully, with performance improving from 500 iterations/second to 2100 iterations/second. Buffer cache implementation is planned for a later stage.\n\nThe initial pull request was eventually closed as the backbone was merged into main, with additional commits pushed for specific functionalities like matrix multiplication and sorting.\n",

    "summary": "The article reports that Cloudflare has begun blocking access to around 200 pirate site domains for users in the UK, triggered by a legal order requested by the Motion Picture Association (MPA). This is a significant shift, as previously, blocking was primarily handled by individual UK Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like BT, Virgin Media, and Sky.\n\nCloudflare is implementing this block through Error 451, indicating a website is blocked for legal reasons specific to the UK. While Cloudflare generally resists blocking orders, they comply when proportionality, due process, and transparency principles are upheld. However, the transparency surrounding this particular order is limited. The link provided by Cloudflare to details about the order leads to the Lumen Database, but lacks specifics like the requesting party and issuing authority.\n\nInterestingly, the linked notice is one sent to Google, not Cloudflare, regarding the de-indexing of the same domains from Google Search. It's also dated over a year ago, raising questions about the timing and nature of Cloudflare's involvement.\n\nCloudflare is utilizing geo-blocking, impacting even UK-based VPN users attempting to access these sites. While the article initially mentions around 200 domains, it suggests the scale could be far larger, potentially involving hundreds or thousands of domains blocked by the MPA. The blocked sites are flagged as triggering serious malware warnings, so users are advised to avoid them.

    "summary": "This article critiques a trend in recent movies the author calls \"The New Literalism.\" It's characterized by heavy-handedness, a tendency to state the obvious, and a lack of subtlety, which ultimately diminishes the art. The author illustrates this with hypothetical examples from \"Gladiator II,\" \"Megalopolis,\" and \"The Apprentice,\" where characters inexplicably verbalize metaphors in an extremely direct and jarring manner.\n\nThe author contends that this literalism pervades even acclaimed films, citing examples from the Academy Award nominees such as \"Dune: Part Two,\" \"Wicked,\" \"A Complete Unknown,\" \"Anora,\" \"The Substance,\" \"Emilia Pérez,\" \"Nickel Boys,\" \"The Brutalist,\" and \"I'm Still Here.\" These films, according to the author, rely on predictable formulas, gratuitous visual cues, and explicit restatements of themes, instead of leaving room for interpretation.\n\nThe author connects this trend to a broader cultural phenomenon: a preference for the familiar, formulaic, and easily digestible content.

    "summary": "Kiro is a new AI-powered IDE designed to bridge the gap between AI-assisted prototyping and production-ready software. It emphasizes \"spec-driven development\" to address the challenges of undocumented assumptions, unclear requirements, and design complexities inherent in AI-generated code.\n\nKiro introduces two key features: **Specs and Hooks.** Specs are artifacts that help developers think through features in-depth, refactor code upfront, and understand system behavior. Kiro unpacks requirements from a single prompt, generating user stories with acceptance criteria, technical design documents (data flow diagrams, interfaces, database schemas), and implementation tasks with details like unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility considerations. Specs also stay synced with the evolving codebase.\n\nHooks are event-driven automations that act like experienced developers, catching inconsistencies and completing boilerplate tasks. These triggers are based on file saves, creations, or deletions, and can be customized to enforce coding standards, update documentation, or scan for security vulnerabilities.\n\nBeyond Specs and Hooks, Kiro includes features like Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, steering rules, and agentic chat. It's built on Code OSS, ensuring compatibility with VS Code settings and plugins.\n\nKiro aims to improve team design alignment, resolve conflicting requirements, reduce tech debt, improve code reviews, and preserve institutional knowledge. Kiro is currently free during preview and available on Mac, Windows, and Linux, supporting most popular languages. It offers a hands-on tutorial.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the popularity of VHS, VCDs, and Laserdiscs in Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, contrasting it with the dominance of VHS in Western markets like Australia and the US. While VHS tapes were available in Singapore, VCDs and Laserdiscs gained more traction. The common explanation for this is the tropical climate causing mold issues on tapes, which is partly true; tapes brought from Australia often developed mold. However, locally produced VHS tapes in Singapore seemed less susceptible.\n\nLaserdiscs, popular among affluent movie enthusiasts and rental stores due to their superior longevity in humid climates and integration with the Japanese export market, were still expensive. VCDs then became the dominant format in the 1990s because of their affordability and ease of distribution.\n\nVCDs, leveraging the same technology as audio CDs, compressed video into a smaller size, allowing it to be stored on a CD. Advantages included small size, durability, and the ability to be easily mass-produced and pirated. The prevalence of pirate VCDs, readily available for a few dollars, made them a popular choice, especially given the Singaporean government's clampdown, which caused the pirated market to move to Malaysia. Legitimate VCDs also existed, offering affordable access to popular shows.\n\nThe article concludes that while climate played a role, economics was a significant driving factor in the popularity of VCDs in Southeast Asia, lasting into the DVD era as a more affordable option.\n",

    "summary": "The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration detected the most massive black hole merger to date, designated GW231123, on November 23, 2023. This powerful merger resulted in a final black hole with a mass of approximately 225 times that of our Sun, surpassing the previous record holder from 2021. The black hole was formed by the collision of two black holes, each approximately 100 and 140 times the mass of the Sun, which were also rapidly spinning.\n\nThis discovery challenges current astrophysical models of black hole formation because black holes of this mass are not expected through standard stellar evolution. Researchers suggest that the black holes might have formed through earlier mergers of smaller black holes. The event pushes the limits of gravitational-wave detection technology and theoretical models, requiring intricate models to accurately interpret the signal.\n\nScientists are continuing to refine their analysis of GW231123, hoping to uncover all of its implications. The data will be made available for other researchers to analyze. The findings will be presented at the GR-Amaldi meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, UK, in July 2025. The discovery highlights the importance of gravitational-wave astronomy in revealing the fundamental nature of black holes and the potential for further discoveries in the field.\n",

    "summary": "This is a review of Simeon Underwood's book \"English Translators of Homer.\" The reviewer feels the title is misleading, as they expected a comparison of translations, whereas the book is a history of the translators themselves and their choices. The reviewer criticizes the book for being too short and lacking textual examples to illustrate Underwood's points about each translator's style.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the reviewer ultimately finds the book \"good.\" It clarifies how to think about different translations and what to look for in them. Underwood's central argument is that translation is a balance between preserving the source text and creating a readable target text, especially challenging with poetry. He explores the dilemma of whether to capture the experience of an ancient reader or create a similar mood for a modern one.\n\nThe reviewer found chapters on Chapman, Pope, and Rieu dull, but appreciated the final chapter on Christopher Logue's \"War Music,\" a modern adaptation of the Iliad. Logue's approach, though controversial, highlights the choices inherent in translation. The reviewer contrasts Logue's work with more literal translations like Lattimore's, which prioritizes line-by-line correspondence to the Greek. The reviewer points to Knox's scathing review of Logue as evidence of the stylistic divide, finding Knox's criticisms ultimately compelling. The reviewer prefers translations like Mitchell and Lombardo, but finds value in Logue's approach for opening new perspectives on the original text. The reviewer concludes that while the book has its flaws, it has valuable insights.\n",

    "summary": "The article \"Random selection is necessary to create stable meritocratic institutions\" argues that true meritocracy is impossible to achieve without incorporating elements of random selection, or \"lottocracy.\" The author contends that seemingly meritocratic systems inevitably devolve into self-perpetuating oligarchies where privilege and connections, rather than pure merit, determine success. This happens because advantages accumulate over generations, creating unequal starting points that are difficult to overcome.\n\nThe author argues that random selection, especially in leadership positions, acts as a necessary corrective. It prevents the entrenchment of power, disrupts existing networks of privilege, and introduces diverse perspectives. By occasionally bypassing the established hierarchy and giving opportunities to individuals from outside the traditional power structure, lottocracy helps ensure that the system remains open and responsive to new ideas and talent.\n\nThe piece emphasizes that lottocracy isn't about eliminating merit entirely; rather, it's about supplementing it to prevent the corruption and stagnation that inevitably accompany purely merit-based systems. The author suggests that incorporating elements of random selection can lead to more robust, fair, and adaptable institutions that are truly representative of a broad range of talent and perspectives. The conclusion is that a well-designed system balances merit and randomness, fostering a more just and ultimately more effective society.\n",

    "summary": "The ClickPipes team encountered a persistent bug where creating logical replication slots on Postgres read replicas would sometimes stall indefinitely, becoming unkillable and risking WAL retention leading to storage exhaustion. This was traced to the `XactLockTableWait` function in Postgres, which waits for older transactions to complete before creating the slot, ensuring a consistent point for decoding.\n\nOn primary Postgres instances, `XactLockTableWait` acquires a lock on the transaction ID, waiting until the transaction completes. However, on read replicas (hot standbys), the `LockAcquire` returns immediately, bypassing the intended interrupt handling. The function then enters a 1ms polling loop using `TransactionIdIsInProgress` and `pg_usleep`, which, due to the standby's indirect observation of primary transactions, can run indefinitely. The absence of interrupt checks in this loop renders the process unkillable via `SIGTERM` or `pg_cancel_backend`.\n\nThe team submitted a patch adding `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS()` before each `pg_usleep` call within the loop, which was quickly accepted and backported to supported Postgres versions, allowing for process termination. Further improvements are being discussed to add a wait event and optimize the transaction completion waiting mechanism for standbys, potentially making it into Postgres 19. The issue highlights how well-written code can cause unexpected problems when used in contexts beyond its original design.\n",

The pool manages connections, not transactions (requiring manual `commit()` or `rollback()`). Optimized SQLite pragmas for high-performance, such as `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`, are recommended.\n\n`aiosqlitepool` integrates well with FastAPI using lifespan context managers for lifecycle management, app state for global access, and dependency injection for easy connection access.\n\nWhile SQLite connection overhead is low, `aiosqlitepool` helps alleviate write contention in concurrent environments. It's recommended for services handling steady web traffic or high-throughput jobs, and applications needing predictable low latency or aiming for a minimal footprint.

Their findings reveal:\n\n*   Model performance consistently degrades with increasing input length.\n*   Lower needle-question similarity exacerbates performance degradation.\n*   Distractors have a non-uniform impact, highlighting model-specific vulnerabilities to irrelevant information, particularly as input length grows.\n*   Needle-haystack similarity impacts performance, indicating the haystack's content is relevant.\n*   Haystack structure (coherent vs. shuffled content) affects how models process long inputs.\n\nThe authors emphasize that real-world applications, which are more complex than NIAH, likely experience even more pronounced performance degradation due to context length. They provide the complete codebase for replicating their results, contributing to a deeper understanding of LLM behavior with long inputs. The study calls for a reassessment of long-context evaluations, moving beyond simple lexical retrieval to more representative and nuanced benchmarks.\n",

    "summary": "In October 2013, the world celebrated the 100th anniversary of Ford's moving assembly line, a pivotal innovation that revolutionized manufacturing. Implemented at Ford's Highland Park plant on October 7, 1913, the moving assembly line dramatically reduced Model T assembly time from over 12 hours to under three hours initially, and eventually to 93 minutes. This was achieved by having 140 assemblers stationed along a 150-foot chassis line, with the work brought to them.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the assembly line wasn't a singular invention but an evolution fueled by several factors: the need to meet Model T demand, benchmarking practices from other industries (meat-packing, mail-order, and canning), and the availability of electric-powered tools and conveyors.\n\nKey figures like Clarence Avery and Charles Sorensen are highlighted for their roles in experimentation and implementation. Sorensen, as Ford's production chief, oversaw the installation of overhead conveyors and the overall refinement of the process, while Avery is often credited with first proposing the moving line concept.\n\nThe article also debunks the myth of Henry Ford being the sole inventor, crediting a team of talented individuals encouraged to experiment and innovate. It further highlights the absence of patents on the process due to Ford's opposition to them.\n\nThe assembly line's success led to a production surge and price reduction for the Model T. The article concludes with three key lessons: hire talented people and let them experiment, benchmark best practices from other industries, and develop and implement state-of-the-art technology.\n",

The Empress of Ireland, a Canadian Pacific Railway ship, sank after colliding with the Storstad, claiming more lives than the Titanic, but is largely forgotten due to its passengers being primarily ordinary Canadians rather than the wealthy elite.\n\nLazarus was hired by Hugh Verrier, fascinated by the narrative of Davidson's supposed miraculous six-kilometer swim to shore, which experts deemed impossible. Verrier wanted to verify the truth behind the repeated claim.\n\nLazarus's research uncovered that Davidson was a PhD student travelling for a study trip. She located Davidson's family and a crucial newspaper clipping of his own account of the disaster. This revealed that the initial report in the Vancouver Province, claiming he swam to shore, was fabricated by a reporter. Davidson actually survived by being rescued by a lifeboat and taken to the Storstad.\n\nThe article also provides context on the Empress's final voyage and the events leading to its sinking. Fog and the Storstad's reinforced hull contributed to the rapid flooding and loss of life. The Empress sank in just fourteen minutes.\n\nThe article concludes by explaining why the Empress tragedy faded from public memory: the outbreak of World War I overshadowed the event, and many survivors, including Davidson, faced the horrors of war soon after.

It begins by explaining the role of a lexer (or tokenizer) in a compilation pipeline, converting a character stream into a token stream. The article defines the structure of tokens in purple-garden, including token type, string value, and positional information.\n\nThe core of the article focuses on optimization techniques. One key strategy is **Threaded Lexing** (using computed gotos), which replaces switch statements with direct jumps to code blocks associated with specific characters. This approach, while potentially complex and not supported by all compilers (like MSVC), significantly improves performance by reducing code density, cache misses, and branch prediction.\n\nAnother optimization is abstracting memory allocation using an **Allocator Interface**. This allows the user to choose different allocation strategies, such as garbage collectors or bump allocators. The interface includes functions for memory request, destruction, and statistics gathering, simplifying memory management within the lexer and other components. The article includes a CALL macro to streamline context passing and enable verbose allocation logging for debugging.\n\nThe author provides benchmark results demonstrating the impact of these optimizations, specifically the bump allocator implementation showing a 1.58x speed improvement in overall runtime.\n",

The researcher discovered a design flaw allowing login bypass with minimal effort, essentially enabling unauthorized access to a user's bank account with just a phone number and some social engineering.\n\nDespite adhering to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) principles, the researcher faced resistance. KBC's responsible disclosure policy required ID verification on the Intigriti platform, making the researcher uncomfortable. The CCB initially claimed the reporter shouldn't contact them due to KBC's policy, a statement contradicted by Belgian law.\n\nThe CCB subsequently downplayed the vulnerability, labeling it a phishing technique rather than a technical flaw, while acknowledging that itsme had implemented a \"Proof of Possession of Registration\" (PoPR) mechanism as mitigation. The researcher, however, never witnessed this security measure in action when using KBC eBanking.\n\nThe author ultimately believes the Belgian CVD system is fundamentally broken, criticizing the law, the CCB's handling of the report, and KBC's demanding disclosure process. The piece aims to highlight the lack of protection for vulnerability reporters and the counterproductive secrecy surrounding CVD in Belgium.

Crucially, the article emphasizes the importance of preserving the asio executor context by using `asio::get_associated_executor` and `asio::post` to ensure the final handler call occurs in the correct context.\n\nThe article provides example code demonstrating the conversion's usage with database queries and error handling scenarios. It highlights the benefits of this approach, including seamless coroutine integration, compile-time type safety, performance optimization, and thread safety.  It's applicable in scenarios like database operations, file I/O, integrating third-party libraries, and handling CPU-intensive tasks. The author concludes that this method offers an efficient and robust solution for modern C++ asynchronous programming.\n",

    "summary": "ProPublica's investigation reveals that Microsoft utilizes a little-known program involving \"digital escorts\" to maintain the Defense Department's computer systems, potentially exposing sensitive data to Chinese hackers. The arrangement, critical to Microsoft's federal cloud computing business, relies on U.S. citizens with security clearances (the escorts) to supervise engineers in China and elsewhere.\n\nThe core issue is that these escorts often lack the technical expertise to adequately monitor the foreign engineers, who may possess more advanced skills. This creates a vulnerability where malicious code could be introduced undetected. Despite warnings from various individuals, including a Microsoft cybersecurity leader, the company allegedly expanded the program.\n\nFormer government officials and national security experts express surprise and concern, emphasizing China's active cyber threat. The system handles sensitive but unclassified information, including data vital for life protection and financial security. Experts say that the escorts would have no idea if the Chinese engineers put in malicious code.\n\nMicrosoft maintains that its processes meet US Government requirements and that foreign workers lack direct access to customer data. They highlight training for escorts and an internal review process called \"Lockbox.\" However, the article emphasizes that the escorts may not be able to detect malicious code.\n\nThe digital escort system arose from the challenge of meeting stringent U.S. citizen requirements for handling sensitive data while leveraging Microsoft's global workforce. A former Microsoft manager described it as \"the path of least resistance,\" chosen over more costly alternatives.\n",

    "summary": "This article demonstrates how to embed user-defined indexes within Apache Parquet files without breaking compatibility with standard Parquet readers. The core idea is to leverage Parquet's footer metadata and offset-based addressing to store index data within the file body and record its location in the footer as a key/value pair.\n\nThe authors argue that this approach offers a balance between the benefits of external indexes (improved query performance) and the simplicity of the Parquet format, avoiding the drawbacks of external indexes like increased complexity and synchronization risks.\n\nThe article provides a concrete example of embedding a \"distinct value index,\" a set of unique values for a specific column, within a Parquet file. This index can be used to efficiently prune files during query execution, skipping those that don't contain relevant values. The example demonstrates how to serialize the index into a binary format, write it into the file body, record its location in the footer, and then extend Apache DataFusion's TableProvider to read and utilize the index for file-level pruning.\n\nThe benefits of this approach are highlighted: standard Parquet readers will simply ignore the unknown index bytes and key/value metadata, while engines aware of the custom index can leverage it for faster query execution. This method allows for various index types and granularities, enabling optimizations for file-level, row-group-level, or even row-level data access.\n",

The letter reveals Heisenberg's radical efforts to discard the classical concept of electron orbits and replace it with a model based purely on observable experimental data. This approach led to his groundbreaking \"Umdeutung\" paper, considered the birth certificate of modern quantum theory.\n\nThe article highlights that Heisenberg's initial work, further developed by Born, Jordan, and Pauli, evolved into matrix mechanics, the first mature formulation of quantum theory, which underlies the Standard Model of particle physics, consistently proven accurate in CERN experiments.\n\nThe celebration of this anniversary prompts a reflection on quantum mechanics' impact, including its ongoing challenges, experimental innovations, and technological advancements. Quantum sensors are expanding into high-energy applications, and quantum simulations are being explored to overcome classical computing limitations in complex system modeling.\n\nDespite its empirical success, the article notes that fundamental questions about the theory's true meaning remain unanswered, sparking theoretical and philosophical debates about the emergence of the classical world, the nature of the wavefunction, and the role of observers. Heisenberg's hopeful sentiment that future physicists will further unravel these mysteries continues to drive research in the field.\n",

    "summary": "This article details various lightning detector circuits, primarily aimed at hobbyists and beginners. It begins with a simple, beginner-friendly design using a tuned inductor circuit operating near 200 kHz, coupled with a high input impedance Darlington transistor RF amplifier for sensitivity. The circuit is micro-power, drawing minimal current from batteries. A key advantage is the elimination of a tapped tuned circuit.\n\nThe article then explores alternative designs, including:\n\n*   **Magnetic Antenna Version:** Employs a solenoid type inductor tuned to around 5 kHz, offering higher sensitivity to distant lightning but reduced sensitivity to certain local impulse sources.\n*   **Compound Transistor Circuit:** Replaces the Darlington transistor with a compound transistor configuration, suitable for use with a CA3096 transistor array.\n*   **Op-Amp Version:** Uses a micro-power op-amp to rectify more of the lightning pulse, extending the flash duration. However, this version is prone to false triggers from household appliances and is not recommended for general use.\n\nThroughout, the author provides practical advice on component selection, construction techniques, and troubleshooting. The article emphasizes visual clarity with close-up photos and highlights the importance of understanding schematics as electrical connections rather than mechanical layouts. The piece concludes with a practical application of the op-amp version, using it to trigger a large LED lightning bolt lamp for visual effect.\n",

    "summary": "This article investigates lossless compression methods for floating-point images, particularly multi-layer images used in film composition. The author compares OpenEXR (with ZIP and upcoming HTJ2K compression), JPEG-XL, and a custom \"MOP\" (Mesh Optimizer + zstd) solution.\n\nKey findings:\n\n*   **OpenEXR ZIP:** A good baseline, and the author's recommended default.\n*   **OpenEXR HTJ2K:** Offers slightly better compression ratios than ZIP but with noticeably lower compression and decompression performance. Future improvements in performance and multi-layer optimization are possible.\n*   **JPEG-XL:** Can achieve better compression ratios than OpenEXR, especially at higher compression effort levels, but suffers from significantly slower compression and decompression speeds. The author suggests JPEG-XL is not a natural fit for multi-layered, floating-point images currently, being more targeted towards displayable images.\n*   **MOP (Mesh Optimizer + zstd):** The standout performer. Mesh Optimizer alone provides comparable compression to EXR HTJ2K with superior speed. When combined with zstd, MOP achieves compression ratios similar to high-effort JPEG-XL, but with dramatically faster compression and decompression. The author positions this as a strong option for internal, lossless floating-point image compression.\n\nThe author concludes that while JPEG-XL has potential, OpenEXR ZIP remains a solid choice, and the custom MOP solution offers a compelling alternative for internal use due to its speed and compression ratio advantages. The article also notes the tests are performed on a limited data set and encourages further exploration, especially in lossy compression.\n",

    "summary": "In July 2025, ProPublica reported that the IRS, under the Trump administration, is developing a computer system to share taxpayer data with ICE, enabling mass deportations. This system would grant ICE unprecedented access to home addresses of individuals they seek to deport through an \"on-demand\" process.\n\nThe plan faced internal resistance, with IRS acting general counsel Andrew De Mello refusing to release millions of addresses due to legal concerns, leading to his ouster. Critics, including former IRS officials and privacy experts, fear the system violates taxpayer privacy laws and could result in incorrect addresses being used, targeting innocent individuals.\n\nThe blueprint reveals an automated system where DHS submits spreadsheets of names and previous addresses, and the IRS returns the most recent address on file. Experts worry about the potential for errors due to name matching instead of taxpayer identification numbers and the lack of independent verification of DHS requests.\n\nThe White House defends the system as legal and fulfilling Trump's campaign promise for mass deportations. However, concerns persist about expanding the agreement to include data on U.S. citizens. The article also highlights the influence of Elon Musk's DOGE, who restructured the IRS engineering staff and led efforts to create a master database. Senator Ron Wyden criticized the system as ripe for abuse, allowing \"fishing expeditions\" into IRS records.\n",

These X-rays offer a visual depiction of the restrictive nature of corsets and their potential to displace and deform the rib cage, spine, and abdominal organs.\n\nThe key takeaway from the images is the demonstrable physical impact of prolonged corset wearing. The images highlight the compression and reshaping of the rib cage, the potential for lower ribs to be pushed inward, and the displacement of organs like the liver and stomach. This provides visual evidence supporting contemporary concerns about the health consequences of corsetry.\n\nThe article serves as a historical record of medical understanding and social attitudes towards fashion in the early 20th century. It demonstrates the evolving use of technology, specifically X-rays, to analyze and critique societal practices like the wearing of corsets. The images contribute to the discourse surrounding body image, fashion trends, and the potential health hazards associated with restrictive clothing. In essence, the X-rays serve as a powerful visual statement on the constraints placed upon women's bodies during that era.\n",

    "url": "https://securelist.com/open-source-package-for-cursor-ai-turned-into-a-crypto-heist/116908/",
    "summary": "This article details how a blockchain developer lost $500,000 in crypto assets due to a malicious code highlighting extension for Cursor AI, a Visual Studio Code-based IDE. The extension, posing as a syntax highlighter for Solidity code, was available in the Open VSX registry and had been downloaded over 54,000 times. However, it was a fake and contained no syntax highlighting functionality, instead downloading and executing malicious PowerShell scripts.\n\nThe developer was tricked into installing the malicious extension because it ranked higher in search results than the legitimate one due to the Open VSX registry's ranking algorithm, which prioritizes recency along with other factors like download count. The PowerShell scripts installed ScreenConnect, a remote management software, allowing attackers to control the developer's computer.\n\nThe attackers then used ScreenConnect to upload VBScripts that downloaded further payloads, including the Quasar backdoor and a stealer that collected data from browsers, email clients, and crypto wallets. This allowed them to steal the developer's wallet passphrases and siphon off cryptocurrency.\n\nAfter the initial malicious extension was removed, the attackers published another fake with the same name as the legitimate extension and inflated download numbers. They also employed similar tactics with other packages, including an npm package called \"solsafe\" and several Visual Studio Code extensions. The article emphasizes the growing threat of malicious open-source packages and recommends caution when downloading tools, verifying their authenticity, and using security solutions.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "一位区块链开发者因一款针对基于 Visual Studio Code 的 IDE Cursor AI 的恶意代码高亮扩展程序，损失了 50 万美元的加密资产。该扩展在 Open VSX 注册表中可用，伪装成 Solidity 代码的语法高亮器，已被下载超过 54,000 次。然而，它是一个假冒程序，不包含任何语法高亮功能，而是下载并执行恶意的 PowerShell 脚本。\n\n由于 Open VSX 注册表的排名算法优先考虑时间新近度以及下载量等其他因素，该开发者被欺骗安装了该恶意扩展程序，因为它在搜索结果中的排名高于合法的扩展程序。PowerShell 脚本安装了 ScreenConnect（一款远程管理软件），使攻击者能够控制该开发者的计算机。\n\n然后，攻击者使用 ScreenConnect 上传 VBScript，下载更多有效载荷，包括 Quasar 后门程序和一个窃取器，该窃取器从浏览器、电子邮件客户端和加密钱包中收集数据。这使得他们能够窃取该开发者的钱包密码短语并窃取加密货币。\n\n在最初的恶意扩展程序被删除后，攻击者发布了另一个与合法扩展程序同名的假冒程序，并人为地增加了下载量。他们还对其他软件包采用了类似的策略，包括一个名为“solsafe”的 npm 软件包和几个 Visual Studio Code 扩展程序。本文强调了恶意开源软件包日益增长的威胁，并建议在下载工具时保持谨慎，验证其真实性，并使用安全解决方案。"

    "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02527-3",
    "summary": "This article investigates the link between East Asian efforts to reduce air pollution and the acceleration of global surface warming since 2010. Using simulations from eight Earth System Models, the study demonstrates that a 75% reduction in East Asian sulfate emissions leads to a global annual mean warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C. This warming is attributed to the unmasking of greenhouse gas-driven warming previously offset by aerosols.\n\nKey findings include a rapidly evolving global warming trend, warming in the North Pacific, and a top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance, all consistent with recent observations. The study highlights that East Asian aerosol cleanup is likely a key contributor to both the recent acceleration in global warming rate and Pacific warming trends.\n\nThe simulations reveal robust changes in temperature and precipitation due to reduced East Asian aerosol emissions. While the strongest warming (~1°C) occurs near the source region, significant warming also extends to the North Pacific. The study acknowledges inter-model variability and the influence of internal variability, emphasizing the need for large ensemble simulations to accurately quantify climate impacts of regional emissions changes. The findings suggest that the recent efforts to improve air quality in East Asia are significantly impacting the global climate, contributing to the acceleration of global warming.\n",
