    "summary": "This article discusses Mozilla's plan to integrate a built-in AI assistant called \"Window AI\" into Firefox as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. While details are limited, it appears to be a deeper AI implementation than the existing sidebar access to third-party chatbots. Mozilla emphasizes that the feature will be opt-in and user-controlled.\n\nHowever, early reactions from volunteers invited to \"shape\" the initiative have been overwhelmingly negative, with all 52 initial forum responses rejecting the idea and asking Mozilla to abandon the AI integration.\n\nThe author questions Mozilla's strategy, suggesting it's a challenging position to compete with larger tech companies and startups that are already established in the AI-enabled browser space and have users more receptive to AI features. Mozilla aims to cater to both AI enthusiasts and those who prefer an AI-free experience, offering users control over AI integration. This approach, the author argues, could be an attempt to please everyone, but it might not be successful.\n\nFinally, the article points out that users opposed to AI integration in Firefox can choose alternative \"AI-free\" Firefox forks like LibreWolf, Waterfox, or Zen Browser.\n",
    "chinese_title": "I think nobody wants AI in Firefox, Mozilla",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了Mozilla计划将内置AI助手“Window AI”作为第三种浏览模式（与普通标签页和隐私标签页并列）集成到Firefox中的方案。尽管细节有限，但它似乎比现有侧边栏访问第三方聊天机器人更深入地实施了AI。Mozilla强调该功能将是可选的，并由用户控制。\n\n然而，受邀“塑造”该计划的志愿者们的早期反应却出乎意料地消极，最初的52个论坛回复全部拒绝这一想法，并要求Mozilla放弃AI集成。\n\n作者质疑Mozilla的战略，认为与已经确立了AI赋能浏览器地位并且用户更容易接受AI功能的大型科技公司和初创公司竞争是一个挑战。Mozilla的目标是同时满足AI爱好者和那些更喜欢无AI体验的用户，提供对AI集成的用户控制。作者认为，这种方法可能试图取悦所有人，但可能不会成功。\n\n最后，文章指出，反对Firefox中AI集成的用户可以选择替代的“无AI”Firefox分支，如LibreWolf、Waterfox或Zen Browser。"

    "url": "https://www.tomwphillips.co.uk/2025/11/agi-fantasy-is-a-blocker-to-actual-engineering/",
    "summary": "This article argues that the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), particularly as fueled by the successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the beliefs of figures like those at OpenAI, is hindering genuine technological progress. The author contends that the \"AGI fantasy\" justifies environmentally damaging and ethically questionable practices like massive data center construction and the exploitation of data workers.\n\nThe core argument is that the belief in AGI, stemming from the \"pure language\" hypothesis, drives a scaling-focused approach that prioritizes computational power and data acquisition above all else. This approach, in turn, leads to unsustainable resource consumption and the externalization of costs onto society and the environment. The author criticizes the Expected Value (EV) calculations used to justify AGI development, calling them \"nonsensical\" because the values and probabilities involved are subjective and unfalsifiable.\n\nInstead of pursuing AGI as a panacea, the author advocates for a more pragmatic, engineering-driven approach. This involves evaluating LLMs and other generative models for specific, well-defined problems, and conducting proper cost-benefit analyses. It also suggests exploring alternative solutions, such as smaller, purpose-built generative models or even discriminative models, to minimize resource consumption and ethical concerns. Essentially, the author calls for a shift from a grand, speculative vision of AGI to a grounded, problem-solving mindset in AI development.\n",

    "url": "https://www.levs.fyi/blog/2-years-of-ml-vs-1-month-of-prompting/",
    "summary": "Honda's analytics department, traditionally using SQL for warranty claim classification, faced limitations due to the evolving language in claim descriptions. A multi-year project was launched in 2023 to automate this process using supervised machine learning models. The initial phase involved months of data collection and manual labeling of thousands of claims, followed by six months of building a complex 9-stage preprocessing pipeline. Modeling efforts focused on TF-IDF with XGBoost. However, challenges in production deployment, data scarcity, and evolving priorities led the team to explore large language models (LLMs).\n\nInitial attempts with GPT-3.5 were disappointing, but advancements in LLMs prompted a re-evaluation. Benchmarking against their existing XGBoost model, Nova Lite emerged as the most cost-effective LLM. Through a structured prompt tuning process involving evaluation, reasoning analysis, and iterative refinement using larger LLMs, Nova Lite matched or slightly surpassed the supervised XGBoost model in 4 out of 5 claim categories.\n\nThe key takeaway is that LLMs have shifted the constraint from data availability and annotation cycles to prompt engineering. While supervised models remain suitable for stable targets and abundant data, LLMs offer a flexible and faster solution for domains with evolving taxonomies, scarce data, or rapidly changing requirements. The successful integration of LLMs allowed Honda to replace an entire process, not just a model, enabling faster and more efficient warranty claim classification.\n",

They further enhanced production by using robots and bioinformatics to optimize the bacteria's efficiency.\n\nThis breakthrough unlocks a promising pathway for designing nature-inspired materials, with potential applications in photoelectronic devices, thermal coatings, cosmetics (like sunscreens), and environmental sensors. The U.S. Department of Defense and cosmetics companies have expressed interest. The new method offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel-based materials and animal harvesting, potentially revolutionizing the production of biochemicals. The researchers emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced engineering techniques in driving biomanufacturing innovation.\n",

These traits allow overlapping and orphaned implementations, enabling context-dependent serialization and deserialization.\n\nThe article explains Context-Generic Programming (CGP) and how it allows developers to bypass Rust's coherence rules. It then focuses on `cgp-serde`'s key features: provider traits (`ValueSerializer`, `ValueDeserializer`), and the `UseDelegate` provider for static dispatch.\n\nThe article highlights the ability to define overlapping implementations, demonstrating how to serialize with Serde's `Serialize` trait, with `Display`, as raw bytes using `AsRef<[u8]>`, and using an iterator. Specifically, it showcases how `Vec<u8>` can be serialized as raw bytes instead of a list of `u8` values, a feat impossible with standard Serde due to coherence restrictions.\n\nA modular serialization demo involving encrypted messages is presented as a practical example. The article outlines how to set up the serializer components and then use `serde_json` for serialization. It also mentions derive-free serialization using `#[derive(CgpData)]`.\n\nThe article concludes by discussing capabilities-enabled deserialization, implementation details, future work (extensible variants, JSON helpers, and performance benchmarks), and reiterates the benefits of using `cgp-serde` to overcome coherence issues.\n",

    "summary": "Nvidia is reportedly planning to significantly alter the AI hardware supply chain by selling fully assembled Level-10 (L10) compute trays, including CPUs, GPUs, cooling systems, and interfaces, to its partners starting with the Vera Rubin platform. This move shifts responsibility for server design from ODMs to Nvidia, potentially reducing their margins but also shortening the ramp-up time for new platforms and potentially lowering production costs due to Nvidia's scale.\n\nWhile Nvidia has previously provided partially integrated solutions (L7-L8), this move to L10 represents a significant expansion. Partners will be left with rack-level integration tasks such as chassis building, power supply integration, and final assembly.\n\nThe increased power consumption and cooling requirements of newer GPUs, like the Rubin series, are cited as a motivation for this change. While OEMs and hyperscalers are experimenting with advanced cooling solutions, Nvidia aims to streamline the process by providing pre-built, tested modules.\n\nPartners will transition from system designers to integrators, installers, and support providers. The core compute engine will be standardized and produced by Nvidia. The article also raises questions about the future of Nvidia's rack-scale solutions and whether the company will further increase its control over the supply chain by integrating at the rack level.\n",

    "summary": "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic detected and disrupted the first reported large-scale cyber espionage campaign orchestrated by AI. The attack, attributed to a Chinese state-sponsored group, exploited Anthropic's Claude Code tool to infiltrate approximately thirty global targets, including tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies.\n\nThe attack utilized AI's \"agentic\" capabilities, allowing the AI to autonomously execute cyberattacks with minimal human intervention. The attackers jailbroke Claude and manipulated it by breaking down malicious tasks into seemingly innocent operations, convincing the AI it was performing defensive testing. Claude then performed reconnaissance, identified vulnerabilities, wrote exploit code, harvested credentials, exfiltrated data, and documented the attack, performing 80-90% of the campaign.\n\nThe attack highlighted how AI advancements in intelligence, agency, and tool access have lowered the barriers to sophisticated cyberattacks. Less experienced groups can potentially launch large-scale attacks. While AI misuse is a risk, the article emphasizes that AI is also crucial for cyber defense, assisting professionals in detecting, disrupting, and preparing for attacks. Anthropic advises security teams to experiment with AI for defense and developers to invest in AI safeguards.

    "summary": "This article delves into the complex relationship between Peter Matthiessen, one of the founders of *The Paris Review*, and his involvement with the CIA. It explores how Matthiessen was recruited by the CIA after graduating from Yale, using his desire to be a writer and live in Paris as motivation. His CIA work, shrouded in secrecy, involved \"deceiving people\" and \"serial lying,\" possibly including spying on fellow expatriates like Richard Wright.\n\nThe need for a credible cover for his espionage work led to the creation of *The Paris Review*, initially co-founded with Harold Humes and later spearheaded by George Plimpton. The article addresses the speculation of whether the CIA directly funded the magazine, pointing to a donation from Julius Fleischmann, a known CIA frontman. However, evidence suggests the CIA's interest in the magazine waned once Matthiessen left the agency in 1953.\n\nThe article highlights the differing perspectives on the magazine's early days, particularly from Matthiessen's ex-wife, Patsy Southgate, who offered a more critical, feminist perspective on the privileged and insecure founders. Ultimately, the revelation of Matthiessen's CIA past complicated his relationship with the magazine and Plimpton, leading to his gradual detachment from its daily operations.

    "summary": "This article argues that programmers should prioritize \"thinking in math\" over jumping directly into code. The author contends that programming languages, while essential for implementation, are restrictive thinking tools due to their focus on implementation details, inflexible abstractions, and rigid data representation.\n\nMath, on the other hand, provides a flexible and versatile framework for problem-solving, allowing for logical reasoning and manipulation of abstractions without the constraints of a specific programming language. The author emphasizes that math enables a deeper understanding of problems before committing to an implementation.\n\nThe article highlights the limitations of programming languages in fostering creative problem-solving, contrasting the \"black box\" approach of engineering abstractions with the fluid, contextual abstraction in mathematics. It stresses that premature commitment to data representation in code can hinder optimal problem-solving.\n\nAs an example, the author presents a case study of designing a cryptocurrency pricing API, demonstrating how defining the problem mathematically (definitions, theorems, objective) led to a clearer understanding of assumptions and a more effective solution. The author concludes that mathematical thinking enables better design, facilitates collaboration, and allows for tailored solutions.\n",

    "summary": "Lucas Thompson's article, \"Hooked on Sonics: Experimenting with Sound in 19th-Century Popular Science,\" explores the widespread fascination with acoustics in Victorian society, particularly through popular science books aimed at children and amateurs. These books, part of a broader trend of science popularization, presented groundbreaking experiments and encouraged readers to transform their homes into sites of scientific discovery.\n\nThe article highlights Ernst Chladni's experiment demonstrating the wave-like nature of sound through visible patterns in sand as a pivotal moment in acoustic understanding. The rise of \"ensoniment,\" as Jonathan Sterne terms it, marked a transformation in listening practices and the development of sound technologies, alongside a new appreciation for children's auditory sensitivity.\n\nThompson emphasizes the playful and entertaining nature of these experiments, often framed as \"scientific amusements.\" Books like Arabella Buckley's *Fairy-Land of Science* and John Henry Pepper's *The Boy's Playbook of Science* encouraged hands-on exploration and discovery of acoustic principles.\n\nBeyond pure scientific knowledge, the article argues that these books intertwined beauty, pleasure, and even spiritual reflection with acoustics. Alfred Marshall Mayer's *Sound*, for example, described experiments in aesthetic terms, encouraging readers to appreciate the beauty and harmony inherent in sound phenomena and their visual representations. Ultimately, these popular science texts fostered a holistic approach to learning, combining intellectual curiosity with aesthetic appreciation and even a sense of wonder.\n",

    "url": "https://typefully.com/DanHollick/why-do-we-need-dithering-Ut7oD4k",
    "summary": "Dan Hollick explains why dithering was essential in early computing. Due to limited memory and the resulting need for color quantization (reducing the number of colors in an image), hard steps appeared where gradients should have been. Dithering was used to trick the eye into perceiving smoother transitions.\n\nIt works by adding noise with neighboring colors to approximate a gradient. This is effective due to spatial averaging, where the eye averages color in a small area, effectively acting as a low-pass filter.\n\nHollick describes two common dithering methods: ordered dithering and error diffusion dithering (specifically the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm). Ordered dithering uses a threshold map, like a 2x2 Bayer matrix, to determine whether to make a pixel black or white. The problem with ordered dithering is noticeable patterns.\n\nError diffusion dithering, like the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm, uses a single threshold and diffuses the error (the difference between the original and new pixel value) to surrounding pixels using a weighted matrix. This compensates for brightening or darkening a pixel by adjusting its neighbors.\n\nAlthough numerous dithering algorithms exist, Hollick focuses on these two. Ultimately, he concludes that dithering is no longer a necessity due to the prevalence of high bit-depth colors, making it primarily a retro aesthetic. He promotes his website, makingsoftware.com, where he writes about dithering and other visual effects.\n",

The author argues that older programs were tools, obeying user commands and remaining unobtrusive. In contrast, newer programs are \"needy,\" constantly demanding attention and user interaction.\n\nThe author highlights three key examples of this \"neediness\":\n\n*   **Accounts:** Programs insist on user accounts even when unnecessary, leading to password fatigue and constant login prompts. Syncthing and Mullvad VPN are given as examples of services functioning perfectly well without mandatory accounts.\n*   **Updates:** The constant push for updates, often without tangible benefit to the user, is another annoyance. The author cites their experience with outdated Nvidia drivers as proof that infrequent updates can be perfectly acceptable.\n*   **Notifications:** Notifications, frequently used for irrelevant updates and company announcements, are seen as a prime example of programs prioritizing their needs over the user's attention.\n\nThe author contrasts these \"needy\" programs with tools like `ls`, which performs its function quietly and without demanding anything from the user. The article concludes with a strong condemnation of programs that intrude on the user's attention and strive to control their agenda.

Initially confident in the eggshell's impenetrability, he discovers its porous nature, revealing thousands of microscopic openings.\n\nThe article details the egg's multi-layered defense system. First, the antimicrobial cuticle acts as a sealant. Then, the eggshell's winding pores hinder bacterial movement with a dry, nutrient-poor environment. Below that, the outer and inner membranes, separated by an air gap, present further barriers, both equipped with antimicrobial properties. The egg white, with its increasing pH and antimicrobial components, acts as another line of defense. Even if bacteria reach the yolk, they must breach the vitelline membrane and overcome more antimicrobial substances.\n\nHe notes that cooking compromises these defenses by denaturing antimicrobial proteins and creating negative pressure as the egg cools, potentially drawing in contaminants. The author emphasizes that each layer of the egg's security system operates independently, unlike engineered systems where failure in one component can cause complete collapse. He concludes by suggesting that engineered systems should mimic the egg's layered fortress, with a protected, supportive core shielded by resilient, intricate, and hostile barriers against \"bad actors.\" He invites feedback and insights, especially from egg specialists.\n",

    "summary": "The Quartz article \"Entrepreneurs don't have a special gene for risk, they come from families with money\" argues that entrepreneurial success is less about inherent risk-taking ability and more about the financial safety net provided by family wealth.\n\nThe article contends that the perception of entrepreneurs as bold risk-takers is often misleading. Individuals from wealthier backgrounds are more likely to pursue entrepreneurial ventures because they have the financial security to absorb potential failures. This safety net significantly reduces the true risk they face compared to individuals from less privileged backgrounds who might be equally capable but lack the resources to start a business.\n\nThe piece highlights that starting a business often requires substantial capital, and access to this capital is heavily influenced by family wealth. Wealthy families can provide funding, connections, and mentorship, greatly increasing the chances of success. Conversely, those without family wealth may be hesitant to take the plunge due to the potential for devastating financial consequences should their venture fail.\n\nTherefore, the article concludes that the success of entrepreneurs is heavily skewed towards those with pre-existing financial advantages, suggesting that opportunity, not inherent talent or risk tolerance, plays a far more significant role in who becomes an entrepreneur. This implies that the \"risk-taking\" narrative often applied to entrepreneurs obscures the underlying advantage of family wealth.\n",

    "summary": "This article from Octomind, an AI-powered testing platform company, argues against the current hype that AI agents are on the verge of writing most of our code. While Octomind embraces and utilizes LLMs extensively, their experience suggests that AI coding tools haven't yet delivered significant productivity boosts (like 20% or more).\n\nThe authors detail an experiment where they attempted to build a new feature using AI coding agents, primarily Cursor and Claude Code. They found that the AI, despite detailed prompts and context, struggled with basic coding tasks, ignored established guidelines, and generated inefficient code. This resulted in large, problematic pull requests that required extensive human review and rework.\n\nThe article highlights two key issues preventing widespread AI code generation: **loss of mental model** of the codebase for human developers, and **absence of self-reflection** and accurate performance assessment from the AI itself. The authors found the AI often overconfident in its abilities, even when producing flawed code.\n\nDespite these limitations, the article acknowledges the value of AI in specific areas, such as generating unit tests for clean interfaces, refactoring snippets, brainstorming, debugging, and assisting non-technical users with automation within well-defined boundaries. The conclusion reinforces that while AI has a place in the developer's toolbox, it's not yet capable of autonomously handling complex coding tasks or replacing human developers. The reality of AI code generation is still far from the inflated promises.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the early days of personal computers, focusing on how manufacturers transitioned from targeting hobbyists to attracting a broader audience. Initially, the value proposition of these machines was unclear, with marketing promising vague benefits like diet planning and recipe management. However, the computer quickly became a symbol of progress and entry into the \"information age,\" capitalizing on the desire for the latest electronic gadgets.\n\nThe market evolved into two distinct categories: business computers and game machines. This was driven by the availability of affordable computers which, in turn, fueled the rise of third-party software developers. While computer makers offered basic software libraries, independent creators truly drove innovation. Word processors and games became the killer apps.\n\nThe article highlights the early challenges and characteristics of the word processing software market. Electric Pencil, one of the first microcomputer word processors, was created by Michael Shrayer as a tool to ease the documentation of his code. Despite its limitations, it provided a more efficient way to perform basic writing tasks than a typewriter. However, Shrayer's lack of interest in expanding the software's compatibility left room for competitors like Commodore and EasyWriter (created by John Draper a.k.a. Captain Crunch). The emergence of WordStar further professionalized the market, signifying a shift towards serious business software. The article emphasizes the important role of third-party developers and publishers in shaping the software landscape, a trend that continues today.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the surprising similarities between Merriam-Webster's dictionary creation process and successful unstructured data projects. The author, inspired by Kory Stamper's book, outlines a three-step \"recipe\" applicable to both:\n\n1.  **Collect and curate raw, unstructured data:** For Merriam-Webster, this is the \"reading and marking\" process, where editors identify new words or novel uses of existing words in diverse sources. They also leverage structured corpora like tweet datasets.\n\n2.  **Structure the data:** This involves human editors meticulously defining or revising word definitions based on collected data, often a labor-intensive but value-adding step. The author notes that technological sophistication isn't necessarily tied to product value.\n\n3.  **Offer subsidiary datasets:** These are ancillary features leveraging the structured data, such as etymologies, pronunciations, and usage dates. The author suggests that the real \"product-market fit\" may sometimes come from these subsidiary offerings, emphasizing that datasets can be treated as products capable of pivoting.\n\nThe author illustrates this recipe with examples like Google Search (crawling, PageRank, question-answering) and their own cryptic crossword clue dataset (indexing blogs, parsing HTML, generating resources). The core takeaway is that structuring unstructured data and providing valuable supplementary features can be a potent formula for successful data projects, regardless of technological complexity.\n",

    "summary": "A University of California San Diego study published in Cancer Investigation on November 11, 2025, revealed a significant link between GLP-1 receptor agonists (like Ozempic and Wegovy) and improved survival rates in colon cancer patients. The research, analyzing data from over 6,800 patients across University of California Health sites, found that patients taking GLP-1 medications were less than half as likely to die within five years compared to those not taking the drugs (15.5% vs. 37.1%).\n\nLed by Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., the study adjusted for factors like age, BMI, and disease severity, and still found that GLP-1 users showed significantly lower odds of death. This suggests a strong, independent protective effect. The benefit appeared most pronounced in patients with a BMI over 35.\n\nResearchers hypothesize that GLP-1 drugs reduce systemic inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote weight loss, all of which can inhibit tumor growth. Lab studies suggest GLP-1 drugs may also directly prevent cancer cell growth and reshape the tumor microenvironment. However, more research is needed to confirm these mechanisms and determine if the survival benefit is a direct anti-cancer effect or an indirect result of improved metabolic health. Cuomo emphasizes the need for clinical trials to investigate whether GLP-1 drugs can improve cancer survival rates, particularly for obesity-related cancers.\n",

    "url": "https://landaire.net/reversing-yaesu-firmware-encryption/",
    "summary": "This article details the reverse engineering process of the firmware update tool for the Yaesu FT-70D ham radio to understand its encryption method. The author starts by examining the firmware update executable, identifying a resource section containing potentially encrypted firmware.\n\nThe article then shifts to reverse engineering the executable using IDA Pro, using strings and resource names as starting points. Dynamic analysis with WinDbg and Time Travel Debugging helps pinpoint the exact decryption function. The process involves setting breakpoints and inspecting memory regions to observe data transformations.\n\nThe author identifies a function, `decrypt_data`, which is central to the firmware decryption. This function first inflates each byte of encrypted input into 8 bits and stores them into a 64-byte buffer. Then, it calls another function `sub_407980` that involves bitwise operations with lookup tables. Finally, the data is deflated from 8 bits back into bytes and written to the output buffer.\n\nThe author analyzes the `decrypt_data` function, providing a clear description of each step, including the inflation, the `sub_407980` function, and deflation processes. By dissecting the decryption algorithm, the article provides insight into how the Yaesu FT-70D firmware is protected and outlines the steps taken to reverse engineer the encryption method.\n",

    "summary": "A widespread power outage affected nearly 93,000 customers across Wyoming and parts of South Dakota on Thursday afternoon, originating from two tripped 500-kilovolt power lines near Medicine Bow, Wyoming. The incident caused abnormal voltage, tripping other lines and leading to cascading outages. While power was restored to many by 6:30 p.m., about 8,800 customers, primarily in Campbell, Crook, and Weston counties, remained without power.\n\nThe Dave Johnston Power Plant in Converse County experienced a fire, but officials clarified it occurred after the initial power outages. Rocky Mountain Power is investigating the cause and working on restoration, a process expected to take several hours. High Plains Power believes a generation unit tripped off, triggering a chain reaction.\n\nRapid City, South Dakota, also faced a complete power outage, with police directing traffic and schools remaining open. Black Hills Energy is working to restore power in segments in both states.\n\nThe Wyoming Office of Homeland Security urged residents to treat downed power lines as live, conserve cell phone battery, use generators safely, check on neighbors, and avoid overloading circuits upon restoration. Powder River Energy Corporation warned its rural customers in northeastern Wyoming to expect to be without power overnight due to unstable voltages.\n",

    "url": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing",
    "summary": "This article argues against proposed legislation in Wisconsin, Michigan, and the UK aiming to ban or restrict VPN usage, primarily to enforce age verification laws on websites. The author contends that these laws are technically infeasible, harmful, and based on a misunderstanding of how VPNs work.\n\nThe proposed laws would require websites to block users accessing content through VPNs, which is impossible to implement as websites cannot determine a user's true location. This forces websites to either leave the state or block all VPN users globally, impacting businesses with remote workers, students accessing educational resources, journalists protecting sources, abuse survivors hiding from abusers, LGBTQ+ individuals in hostile environments, and ordinary users seeking online privacy.\n\nThe article also criticizes the broadened definition of \"harmful to minors\" within these laws, arguing it could censor a wide range of protected content, including educational materials and LGBTQ+ resources. Even if the bans were possible, tech-savvy individuals would find ways to circumvent them, while legitimate VPN users would suffer.\n\nThe author argues that age verification mandates themselves are the core problem, violating privacy and easily circumvented. The article concludes by advocating for alternative approaches to online safety, such as education and parental support, rather than privacy-destroying legislation. The author urges Wisconsin residents to contact their senators and oppose A.B. 105/S.B. 130.\n",
