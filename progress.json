    "url": "https://susam.net/attention-media-vs-social-networks.html",
    "summary": "In \"Attention Media ≠ Social Networks,\" Susam Pal explores the degradation of digital social spaces, arguing that modern platforms have shifted from genuine connection to exploitative \"attention media.\"\n\nPal reflects on the early Web 2.0 era, where social networks focused on meaningful interactions and chronological updates from chosen contacts. He identifies a negative turning point between 2012 and 2016 when platforms introduced features like infinite scroll and \"bogus\" notifications—signals designed not for user relevance, but to hijack attention and maximize engagement. Eventually, curated feeds of friends were replaced by algorithmic streams of content from strangers, making the experience feel like \"standing in front of a blaring loudspeaker.\"\n\nThe author differentiates these modern services from true social networks based on their intent: one serves the user's choices, while the other monetizes their attention. Disenchanted by the mindless scrolling of mainstream media, Pal highlights Mastodon as a return to form. Unlike modern mainstream platforms, Mastodon offers a calm, predictable environment where users only see updates from people they have specifically chosen to follow. By removing algorithmic manipulation and irrelevant notifications, Mastodon restores the original promise of social networking—a space driven by personal choice rather than forced consumption.",
    "chinese_title": "注意力媒体 ≠ 社交网络",
    "chinese_summary": "在《注意力媒体 ≠ 社交网络》一文中，Susam Pal 探讨了数字社交空间的退化，指出现代平台已从真实的连接转变为剥削性的“注意力媒体”。\n\nPal 回顾了 Web 2.0 早期时代，当时的社交网络专注于有意义的互动以及来自选定联系人的按时间顺序排列的更新。他认为 2012 年至 2016 年间是一个负面的转折点，当时平台引入了无限滚动和“虚假”通知等功能——这些信号的设计初衷并非为了提高用户相关性，而是为了劫持注意力并最大化参与度。最终，由朋友组成的精选动态被来自陌生人的算法内容流所取代，这种体验让人感觉像是“站在一个大喇叭前”。\n\n作者根据初衷将这些现代服务与真正的社交网络区分开来：前者服务于用户的选择，而后者则将用户的注意力变现。Pal 对主流媒体中无意识的滚动感到幻灭，他强调 Mastodon 是向社交网络本源的回归。与现代主流平台不同，Mastodon 提供了一个冷静、可预测的环境，用户只能看到他们明确选择关注的人的动态。通过移除算法操纵和无关通知，Mastodon 恢复了社交网络的最初承诺——一个由个人选择而非强迫性消费驱动的空间。"

    "summary": "In the article \"Fix Your Tools,\" the author recounts a debugging experience that serves as a vital lesson for developers. While troubleshooting a complex bug in an open-source library, the author discovered their debugger was failing to hit breakpoints. Instead of addressing the tool’s malfunction, the author initially fell into \"problem-solving mode,\" attempting to diagnose the issue through tedious manual logging.\n\nAfter growing frustrated with these ineffective workarounds, the author realized that their \"tunnel vision\" was hindering progress. By pausing to fix the debugger—which required only a simple one-line configuration change—they gained the necessary insight to resolve the original bug quickly.\n\nThe author concludes that developers often face a paradox: the urgent desire to solve a problem can lead them to ignore the very tools intended to help. The article serves as a reminder to prioritize the maintenance of your development environment, as functional tools are essential for effective and efficient problem-solving.",

    "title": "What Is a Database Transaction?",
    "url": "https://planetscale.com/blog/database-transactions",
    "summary": "This article explores the mechanics of database transactions, which are sequences of operations treated as a single, atomic unit. Using commands like `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`, transactions ensure that data remains consistent even during system failures or simultaneous user access.\n\nA core challenge in database management is providing \"consistent reads.\" The two most popular SQL databases handle this differently:\n*   **Postgres** uses multi-versioning (MVCC), creating new versions of rows with metadata (`xmin`/`xmax`). It requires a `VACUUM` process to periodically purge obsolete row versions.\n*   **MySQL** overwrites rows directly but maintains an \"undo log\" to reconstruct previous versions for concurrent transactions, avoiding the need for vacuuming.\n\nThe article details four standard isolation levels that balance performance against data integrity:\n1.  **Serializable:** The strictest level; transactions behave as if run sequentially.\n2.  **Repeatable Read:** Prevents most inconsistencies but may allow \"phantom reads\" (newly inserted data appearing mid-transaction).\n3.  **Read Committed:** Prevents \"dirty reads\" but allows \"non-repeatable reads\" (existing data changing mid-transaction).\n4.  **Read Uncommitted:** The most performant but dangerous level; allows \"dirty reads\" of uncommitted data.\n\nFor concurrent writes in **Serializable** mode, the systems again diverge. MySQL employs **row-level locking** (Shared and Exclusive locks), which can lead to deadlocks. Postgres uses **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)**, an optimistic approach that tracks data dependencies via predicate locks and kills conflicting transactions rather than blocking them.\n\nUltimately, the author emphasizes that understanding these isolation levels and internal mechanisms is essential for developers to build effective, high-performance applications that maintain data reliability.",
    "chinese_title": "什么是数据库事务？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了数据库事务的机制，即被视为单个原子单元的一系列操作。通过使用 `BEGIN`、`COMMIT` 和 `ROLLBACK` 等命令，事务可确保即使在系统故障或用户并发访问时，数据也能保持一致性。\n\n数据库管理中的一个核心挑战是提供“一致性读”。两种最流行的 SQL 数据库对此有不同的处理方式：\n*   **Postgres** 使用多版本并发控制 (MVCC)，通过元数据（`xmin`/`xmax`）创建行的新版本。它需要 `VACUUM` 进程来定期清理过期的行版本。\n*   **MySQL** 直接覆盖行，但维护一个“回滚日志”（undo log）来为并发事务重构先前的版本，从而避免了清理的需求。\n\n本文详细介绍了四种在性能与数据完整性之间进行权衡的标准隔离级别：\n1.  **可串行化 (Serializable)**：最严格的级别；事务的表现如同顺序执行。\n2.  **可重复读 (Repeatable Read)**：防止大多数不一致，但可能允许“幻读”（事务过程中出现新插入的数据）。\n3.  **读已提交 (Read Committed)**：防止“脏读”，但允许“不可重复读”（事务过程中现有数据发生变化）。\n4.  **读未提交 (Read Uncommitted)**：性能最高但最危险的级别；允许对未提交数据进行“脏读”。\n\n对于“可串行化”模式下的并发写入，两者的实现再次分道扬镳。MySQL 采用**行级锁**（共享锁和排他锁），这可能导致死锁。Postgres 则使用**可串行化快照隔离 (SSI)**，这是一种乐观方法，通过谓词锁跟踪数据依赖关系，并终止冲突的事务而非对其进行阻塞。\n\n最后，作者强调，理解这些隔离级别和内部机制对于开发人员构建能够保持数据可靠性的高效、高性能应用程序至关重要。"

    "summary": "Researchers tested the ability of AI agents (specifically Claude models) to detect backdoors in ~40MB binary executables using reverse engineering tools like Ghidra and Radare2. By creating a benchmark called **BinaryAudit**, the team injected malicious code into popular open-source projects (e.g., lighttpd, dnsmasq) to see if AI could identify vulnerabilities without access to source code.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n*   **Performance:** Even the most advanced model, Claude Opus 4.6, only detected backdoors 49% of the time. \n*   **High False Positives:** The models reported non-existent vulnerabilities in clean binaries 28% of the time. In professional security, this \"AI slop\" makes the tool currently impractical for production.\n*   **Strategic Failure:** While AI can successfully trace specific function calls (like `popen()` or `system()`), it lacks high-level intuition. It often falls victim to the \"needle-in-a-haystack\" problem, wasting its context window on benign code or \"rationalizing away\" obvious threats. For instance, in one test, the AI found a blatant shell-execution backdoor but incorrectly dismissed it as a legitimate system function.\n\n**Technical Challenges:**\nBinary analysis is significantly harder than source code analysis because compilation strips away variable names and structures, leaving only low-level machine code. Although AI showed a surprising ability to interpret pseudo-C code generated by decompilers, it struggled to distinguish between malicious intent and complex, optimized logic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile AI agents demonstrate specialized reverse engineering capabilities, they are not yet production-ready for malware detection. Their lack of strategic focus and tendency toward hallucinations mean they cannot yet replace human experts in identifying sophisticated supply-chain attacks or firmware vulnerabilities.",
