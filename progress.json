    "title": "Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux",
    "url": "https://www.himthe.dev/blog/microsoft-to-linux",
    "summary": "This article, written from the perspective of early 2026, chronicles a long-time Windows user’s \"forced\" migration to Linux (specifically CachyOS) after 22 years. The author, a software developer and musician, argues that Microsoft has prioritized profit and AI integration over system stability and user consent, transforming the OS into what they call \"Microslop.\"\n\n**Key Reasons for the Switch:**\n*   **System Instability:** The breaking point was the Windows 24H2 update, which installed without consent and introduced a \"Chrome seizure\" bug (related to Multiplane Overlay). Neither Microsoft nor NVIDIA took responsibility for the issue, leaving it unpatched.\n*   **User-Hostile Features:** The author cites forced updates that cause data loss, intrusive ads for OneDrive and Edge, the removal of local account options, and the pervasive, unremovable presence of \"Copilot.\"\n*   **Performance Bloat:** The article criticizes Microsoft's shift toward replacing native system apps with bloated React Native and Chromium-based processes, which consume excessive RAM and reduce responsiveness.\n\n**The Linux Experience in 2026:**\nThe author notes that while Linux requires a learning curve, it offers a \"fixable\" environment. Key takeaways include:\n*   **Compatibility:** Most browsers and development tools run natively. Gaming has reached near-parity with Windows via Proton, and audio latency (via PipeWire) now rivals macOS.\n*   **Creative Work:** While the Adobe Suite and Ableton Live remain problematic, professional alternatives like DaVinci Resolve and Bitwig Studio provide viable workflows.\n*   **Efficiency:** The author highlights the superior speed and responsiveness of the Linux desktop compared to the \"laggy\" Windows 11 interface.\n\nUltimately, the author concludes that Microsoft’s leadership has become the greatest \"Linux evangelist\" by neglecting user satisfaction in favor of \"AI slop,\" effectively driving power users away from the Windows ecosystem.",
    "chinese_title": "微软迫使我改用 Linux",
    "chinese_summary": "这篇文章以2026年初的视角，记录了一位拥有22年机龄的资深Windows用户向Linux（特别是CachyOS）“被迫”迁移的过程。作者是一位软件开发人员兼音乐人，他认为微软将利润和AI集成置于系统稳定性和用户许可之上，将操作系统变成了他所谓的“微软废料”（Microslop）。\n\n**切换的主要原因：**\n*   **系统不稳定：** 导火索是Windows 24H2更新。该更新在未经许可的情况下自动安装，并引入了“Chrome抽搐”Bug（与多平面叠加相关）。微软和NVIDIA对此均未承担责任，导致该问题始终未获修复。\n*   **对用户不友好的特性：** 作者列举了导致数据丢失的强制更新、OneDrive和Edge的侵入式广告、本地账户选项的移除，以及无处不在且无法删除的“Copilot”。\n*   **性能臃肿：** 文中批评了微软将原生系统应用替换为臃肿的React Native和基于Chromium的进程，这些进程消耗了大量内存并降低了系统响应速度。\n\n**2026年的Linux体验：**\n作者指出，虽然Linux有一定的学习成本，但它提供了一个“可修复”的环境。核心收获包括：\n*   **兼容性：** 大多数浏览器和开发工具都能原生运行。通过Proton，游戏性能已接近Windows水平；而通过PipeWire，音频延迟已可与macOS媲美。\n*   **创意工作：** 尽管Adobe系列软件和Ableton Live仍存在兼容问题，但DaVinci Resolve和Bitwig Studio等专业替代方案已能提供可行的工作流。\n*   **效率：** 作者强调，与“卡顿”的Windows 11界面相比，Linux桌面具有更卓越的速度和响应性。\n\n最终，作者总结道，由于微软领导层为了追求“AI垃圾”而忽视用户满意度，他们实际上已成为最伟大的“Linux传教士”，有效地将高级用户赶出了Windows生态系统。"

    "url": "https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/",
    "summary": "\"Airfoil (2024)\" explores the physics of flight by investigating how air flows around wing cross-sections, known as airfoils. Because air is transparent, the article outlines three primary methods for visualizing its motion: **velocity arrows** (showing speed and direction at fixed points), **markers** (tracking the path of air parcels over time), and **color mapping** (representing flow speed through brightness).\n\nA significant portion of the article explains the microscopic nature of air. On a molecular level, air consists of billions of particles moving chaotically at high speeds—averaging 1,030 mph at room temperature—and colliding billions of times per second. The article clarifies the distinction between individual particle motion and collective \"airflow.\" In still air, the random movements of particles average out to a net velocity of zero. Wind or airflow occurs when there is a non-zero average velocity among a group of particles in a specific region. \n\nThe text also introduces key concepts in fluid dynamics:\n*   **Steady Flow:** A state where the flow properties at any given location do not change over time.\n*   **Relative Velocity:** The understanding that airflow is relative; air moving past a stationary object is physically equivalent to an object moving through still air.\n\nBy bridging the gap between chaotic microscopic particle behavior and the orderly macroscopic flow visualized by arrows and colors, the article builds an intuitive foundation for understanding the forces that keep an aircraft airborne. Although the provided text cuts off during the discussion of relative velocity, it establishes that the shape and orientation of an airfoil are critical to manipulating these air properties to generate flight.",
    "chinese_title": "翼型 (2024)",
    "chinese_summary": "《翼型 (2024)》通过研究空气如何流经被称为“翼型”的机翼截面，探讨了飞行的物理学原理。由于空气是透明的，文中概述了三种可视化其运动的主要方法：**速度箭头**（显示固定点的速度和方向）、**标记物**（追踪气团随时间变化的路径）以及**色彩映射**（通过亮度代表流速）。\n\n文章的大部分内容解释了空气的微观本质。在分子层面，空气由数十亿个高速随机运动的粒子组成——在室温下平均速度达每小时 1,030 英里——且每秒发生数十亿次碰撞。文中阐明了单个粒子运动与集体“气流”之间的区别。在静止的空气中，粒子的随机运动相互抵消，净速度为零。当特定区域内的一群粒子具有非零的平均速度时，便产生了风或气流。\n\n文中还介绍了流体力学中的关键概念：\n*   **定常流**：在任何给定位置，流动特性不随时间改变的状态。\n*   **相对速度**：理解气流是相对的；空气流过静止物体在物理上等同于物体穿过静止空气。\n\n通过衔接混沌的微观粒子行为与通过箭头和色彩可视化的有序宏观流动，本文为理解维持飞机升空的力奠定了直观基础。尽管提供的内容在讨论相对速度时中断了，但它明确了翼型的形状和朝向对于操控这些空气特性以产生飞行至关重要。"

    "summary": "Based on recent industry developments and the context of Amazon’s retail strategy, here is a concise summary regarding the status of Amazon One:\n\n**Summary: The Evolution of Amazon One Palm Authentication**\n\nAmazon is currently restructuring its physical retail technology, leading to significant changes for its palm-recognition service, **Amazon One**. While the technology is not being retired entirely, its implementation is shifting.\n\n**Key Information:**\n*   **Retail Pivot:** Amazon recently announced it is removing its \"Just Walk Out\" frictionless checkout technology from large-format Amazon Fresh grocery stores. Because Amazon One was the primary method for customers to enter these stores and trigger the automated billing system, its presence in these specific locations is being discontinued.\n*   **The Replacement:** In large grocery settings, Amazon is replacing the palm-entry system and overhead cameras with \"Dash Carts\"—smart shopping carts that track items in real-time via an onboard screen.\n*   **Continued Use:** Despite scaling back in large grocery stores, Amazon One remains active. It continues to be rolled out across all Whole Foods Market locations and is being expanded to third-party venues, including professional sports stadiums, airports, and partner retailers like Panera Bread.\n*   **Purpose:** The technology remains a core part of Amazon’s biometric strategy, intended to provide a secure, \"contactless\" way for users to pay, verify their age, or enter venues by simply hovering their palm over a scanner.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the \"discontinuation\" refers primarily to its use as the gatekeeper for \"Just Walk Out\" in large-scale grocery environments, Amazon One continues to exist as a standalone payment and identification solution in smaller retail formats and third-party locations.",

    "summary": "Based on the title provided (as the content text you included is actually the standard YouTube legal and footer information), here is a concise summary of the project typically associated with this title (famously created by the YouTube channel **Stuff Made Here**):\n\n**Summary: I Overengineered a Spinning Top**\n\nThe project documents the creation of a \"perfect\" spinning top by applying advanced robotics and aerospace engineering to a simple toy. Rather than relying solely on the physics of a traditional top, the creator designs an **active stabilization system** to prevent it from ever falling over.\n\n**Key Information:**\n*   **The Mechanism:** The top features an internal **reaction wheel** powered by a high-speed brushless motor. This setup mimics the stabilization technology used in satellites and spacecraft.\n*   **Active Control:** It incorporates an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** to detect tilt and a microcontroller that runs a feedback loop. When the top begins to lean, the internal wheel accelerates or decelerates to generate counter-torque, keeping the top perfectly upright.\n*   **Precision Engineering:** The body was custom-machined using CNC technology to ensure near-perfect symmetry, and the electronics were miniaturized to fit within the small, spinning chassis.\n*   **The Result:** The \"overengineered\" top is capable of balancing on a finger, a thin wire, or even a moving platform. It effectively removes the element of human skill, using technology to achieve a state of permanent, robotic equilibrium.\n\nThe project serves as a masterclass in control theory, demonstrating how complex sensors and software can be used to override the natural decay of angular momentum.",
