    "title": "Is Gemini 2.5 good at bounding boxes?",
    "url": "https://simedw.com/2025/07/10/gemini-bounding-boxes/",
    "summary": "This article benchmarks the object detection capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro on the MS-COCO dataset, comparing its performance to established CNN models. The author's goal was to explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to replace traditional CNNs in object detection, eliminating the need for extensive dataset collection and annotation.\n\nThe author used a detailed prompt, including the list of MS-COCO classes and requesting a specific JSON output format with bounding boxes, confidence scores, and masks. Experiments were conducted with different versions of Gemini (Pro, Flash, Flash-Lite), varying \"thinking budgets\" (token limits), and structured/unstructured output formats.\n\nThe primary metric used was mean Average Precision (mAP), which measures the accuracy of the bounding box predictions. The results showed that Gemini 2.5 Pro performed comparably to Yolo v3 (from 2018), achieving approximately 0.34 mAP with structured output. Adding a thinking budget generally decreased performance. The inclusion of mask output caused issues, leading to infinite loops and incomplete testing.\n\nThe author concludes that while CNNs remain faster and more predictable, Gemini's versatility and performance across open-set tasks are promising. Although not surpassing state-of-the-art CNNs in terms of mAP, Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated decent object detection capabilities without explicit training on the MS-COCO dataset, suggesting the potential for MLLMs in computer vision tasks. The author plans to integrate Gemini into future side projects.\n",
    "chinese_title": "Gemini 2.5 擅长边界框吗？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文评估了 Gemini 2.5 Pro 在 MS-COCO 数据集上的目标检测能力，并将其性能与已建立的 CNN 模型进行了比较。作者的目标是探索多模态大型语言模型 (MLLM) 在目标检测中取代传统 CNN 的潜力，从而消除对大量数据集收集和标注的需求。\n\n作者使用了详细的提示，包括 MS-COCO 类别的列表，并请求具有边界框、置信度分数和掩码的特定 JSON 输出格式。 实验使用了不同版本的 Gemini（Pro、Flash、Flash-Lite），改变了“思考预算”（token 限制）以及结构化/非结构化输出格式。\n\n使用的主要指标是平均精度均值 (mAP)，它衡量边界框预测的准确性。 结果表明，Gemini 2.5 Pro 的性能与 Yolo v3 (2018 年) 相当，使用结构化输出实现了约 0.34 mAP。 增加思考预算通常会降低性能。 包含掩码输出会导致问题，从而导致无限循环和不完整的测试。\n\n作者的结论是，虽然 CNN 仍然更快且更可预测，但 Gemini 在开放集任务中的多功能性和性能是有希望的。 尽管在 mAP 方面没有超过最先进的 CNN，但 Gemini 2.5 Pro 在没有明确在 MS-COCO 数据集上进行训练的情况下，表现出了不错的对象检测能力，这表明 MLLM 在计算机视觉任务中具有潜力。 作者计划将 Gemini 集成到未来的副项目中。"

    "summary": "This article analyzes database trends based on 1.8 million Hacker News headlines from February 2007 to June 2025. It uses camelAI and a ClickHouse database to identify trends in database popularity and discussion.\n\nThe analysis reveals that PostgreSQL has experienced consistent growth and dominates recent discussions. MySQL was prominent in the early years but has plateaued. MongoDB peaked around 2013 and has declined, likely due to SQL databases incorporating JSON support. ClickHouse and DuckDB are experiencing rapid growth, driven by the analytics renaissance. Redis and SQLite maintain steady mentions, reflecting their importance as infrastructure components.\n\nThe analysis also identifies the fastest-growing databases: DuckDB, ClickHouse, and Supabase. While PostgreSQL saw a slight year-over-year dip, its long-term growth remains strong. Cloud-native SaaS databases like DynamoDB, BigQuery, and Redshift are losing share of conversation.\n\nDatabases like MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB, BigQuery, and Redshift are experiencing a decline in headline mentions from their peak years, attributed to maturity, open-source competition (Postgres extensions and lakehouses), and a shift in discussion topics to cost, lock-in, and serverless architectures.\n\nThe key takeaways are that open-source databases are driving most new discussions, analytics-focused stores are gaining popularity, consistent improvement trumps hype cycles, and proprietary cloud databases are losing traction. The author suggests further analysis, including identifying databases mentioned as alternatives or replacements, analyzing positive vs. negative headlines, and comparing vector database mentions to traditional databases.\n",

    "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/7-engineers-suspended-after-2-3-million-bridge-includes-bizarre-90-degree-turn/",
    "summary": "A newly constructed $2.3 million bridge in Bhopal, India, has sparked controversy due to its abrupt 90-degree turn. The bridge, intended to alleviate traffic congestion for 300,000 commuters daily, has instead become a source of ridicule and concern for its impractical design.\n\nThe bizarre turn, located midway across the elevated roadway, prompted immediate action from Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, who suspended seven engineers, including two chief engineers. A retired sub-engineer is also facing a departmental inquiry, and the construction and design firms involved have been blacklisted.\n\nThe project's troubled history reveals multiple design revisions over seven years due to disagreements between the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Railways regarding land usage. The original 2018 design with a more manageable 45-degree skew was rejected by the Railways. Subsequent designs attempted to accommodate both the railway property and a new Metro line, ultimately leading to the awkward 90-degree angle.\n\nChief engineer VD Verma defended the design, citing limited land space and the proximity of the Metro station as constraints. However, critics argue that the sharp turn should never have been approved. Even the Railways later admitted the final design was neither functional nor safe.\n\nAuthorities are now considering purchasing additional land to rectify the turn, incurring further costs and delays. The flawed bridge serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of bureaucratic infighting, design compromises, and the potential for bad geometry to result in significant political repercussions.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses a new vulnerability discovered in the Fiat-Shamir transformation, a widely used technique for creating non-interactive proofs in cryptography. The attack, developed by researchers including Dmitry Khovratovich, Ron Rothblum, and Lev Soukhanov, demonstrates a method for tricking proof systems into certifying false statements, even though these systems are considered secure under the random oracle model (assuming hash functions behave like truly random sources).\n\nThe Fiat-Shamir transformation is crucial for verifying computations in various applications, including blockchains and cloud computing, by converting interactive proofs into non-interactive ones. The vulnerability stems from the fact that real-world hash functions aren't perfectly random, allowing attackers to craft malicious programs that exploit the hashing process to generate false proofs.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers targeted a Fiat-Shamir proof system based on the GKR protocol. They created a malicious program that, when given its own hash as input, could compute the random challenges used for verification and manipulate its internal workings to pass inspection, even with incorrect data.\n\nThis finding challenges the long-held assumption about the security of Fiat-Shamir and raises concerns about the security of systems that rely on it, especially in blockchain applications where large sums of money are at stake. While patches and modifications to Fiat-Shamir have been proposed to mitigate the attack, the discovery necessitates a broader reevaluation of the random oracle model and a deeper understanding of the potential vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations.\n",

It allows filtering of AST nodes considered in the diff via a configuration file, enabling precise control over what constitutes a meaningful change.\n\nInstallation options include pre-built binaries from Github releases, building from source with Cargo, using Homebrew, Arch Linux AUR, Alpine Linux repositories, or via a Docker image. Usage involves running the `diffsitter` command with file paths and optional configurations.  It integrates with Git through `.git/config`, offering a semantic diffing experience within a Git workflow. Shell completion scripts can be generated for various shells.\n\nDifsitter can be configured using a config file (default location: `$XDG_HOME/.config/diffsitter/config.json5`) to specify file associations and formatting. The tool also supports dynamic linking of tree-sitter grammars. Issues, feature requests, and questions are welcomed via Github issues and discussions. The project is actively seeking contributions.\n",

The author highlights the issues with previous, more manual approaches using Xcode and proposes a cleaner, more robust solution.\n\nKey points:\n\n*   **Problem:** Integrating Haskell libraries into Swift projects using Xcode directly can be complex, error-prone, and lead to recompilation issues.\n*   **Solution:** Create an independent Swift Package wrapping the Haskell library, which can be built without Xcode.\n*   **`xcframework` Library:** This library automates building the Haskell library with Cabal and creating a Swift package from the Haskell artifacts using Cabal SetupHooks.\n*   **XCFrameworks:** Apple's XCFramework bundles allow for multiplatform binary frameworks, enabling Swift projects to depend on a binary artifact and header files.\n*   **What `xcframework` bundles:** The foreign shared library (.dylib), foreign export headers, RTS headers, and a .modulemap.\n*   **Installation & Usage:** The article provides instructions on installing `xcframework` using Cabal, adding the resulting `.xcframework` to an Xcode project, and importing the Haskell functions in Swift.  It also demonstrates creating a standalone Swift package using swift build.\n*   **Requirement:** The Haskell code must be exported from a Cabal `foreign-library` stanza.\n*   **Benefits:**  The approach is considered a more robust and less error-prone way to add Haskell dependencies to Swift applications.\n*   **Future Work:** The author acknowledges the challenges of marshaling and sharing high-level datatypes across the FFI and mentions ongoing work to automate this using TH and GHC plugins.\n",

    "summary": "This article introduces Tree Borrows, a new model for defining the behavior of unsafe code in Rust. Rust's ownership-based type system ensures memory safety and data race freedom, but unsafe code bypasses these guarantees, potentially hindering compiler optimizations that rely on pointer aliasing assumptions. Previous work, Stacked Borrows, defined rules for \"well-behaved\" unsafe code to enable these optimizations, but it was found to be overly restrictive, rejecting many legitimate unsafe Rust patterns and failing to account for recent advances in the borrow checker.\n\nTree Borrows improves upon Stacked Borrows by replacing the stack structure with a tree. This change allows the model to accept a wider range of valid unsafe code while maintaining safety guarantees. Benchmarking against the 30,000 most popular Rust crates, Tree Borrows rejects significantly fewer test cases than Stacked Borrows (54% reduction).\n\nThe authors prove (using Rocq) that Tree Borrows preserves most of the optimizations enabled by Stacked Borrows, and, crucially, unlocks new optimizations such as read-read reorderings. This improvement allows the compiler to be more aggressive in its optimizations without fear of being invalidated by common patterns in unsafe Rust code. The work was recognized with a Distinguished Paper Award at PLDI'25. Links to the paper, a talk recording, artifact, and source code are provided.\n",

Essentially, MCP-B aims to standardize the way AI agents interact with web browsers, making it easier for AI models to understand and manipulate web content effectively.\n\nInstead of relying solely on traditional methods like CSS selectors or XPath, which can be brittle and sensitive to website changes, MCP-B focuses on providing AI with a more comprehensive \"context\" of the browser state. This context includes information about the DOM (Document Object Model), visual layout, text content, and potentially even user interaction history.\n\nBy offering this richer, more structured data, MCP-B empowers AI agents to:\n\n*   **Better understand the semantic meaning of web elements:** AI can identify buttons, forms, and other interactive elements based on their purpose and context, not just their visual appearance.\n*   **Perform more reliable automation:** Automation scripts become less susceptible to website updates, as the AI can adapt based on semantic understanding rather than relying on specific CSS classes or IDs.\n*   **Facilitate more complex tasks:** AI can handle more intricate workflows, such as filling out multi-step forms, navigating complex menus, and extracting specific information from websites.\n*   **Enhance model training:** The structured browser context provided by MCP-B can be used to train AI models more effectively, leading to improved performance in browser automation tasks.\n\nIn essence, MCP-B aims to bridge the gap between how humans understand and interact with web browsers and how AI agents can achieve the same level of comprehension and control.

Lewis (Institute of Historical Research), the research, drawing heavily on the Exon Domesday manuscript, highlights the speed, efficiency, and intelligence behind the survey's creation and implementation, arguing it was an exercise in governmental control.\n\nThe study emphasizes the rational planning, use of existing systems, and conceptual innovation of Domesday, foreshadowing modern data exploitation. A key revelation is the proposed identity of the Domesday Book's principal scribe: Gerard, William's final chancellor, later Bishop of Hereford and Archbishop of York.\n\nThe researchers used modern forensic and analytical techniques on the Exon Domesday, uncovering collaborative efforts and individual quirks of the scribes, bringing the process of creating the Domesday Book to life. The study culminates in the book *Making Domesday: Intelligent Power in Conquered England*, which positions the Domesday Book as a remarkable feat of administrative innovation.\n",

    "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/46-billion-years-on-the-sun-is-having-a-moment",
    "summary": "The article argues that solar power is rapidly transforming the world's energy system, moving from an \"alternative\" source to the mainstream, cost-efficient choice. The author highlights the exponential growth of solar panel installations globally, with the world adding terawatts of solar power at an accelerating rate. Key statistics emphasize the increasing dominance of renewables in meeting new electricity demand in the US, California, and Texas.\n\nChina is a dominant player, installing more than half of the world's renewable energy and exporting solar panels and batteries. This has implications for countries with strong trade links, leading to a surge of renewable power. South America and even historically coal-dependent nations like Poland are experiencing shifts towards solar and wind.\n\nThe decrease in energy storage costs, particularly batteries, is a crucial factor in enabling a more reliable renewable energy supply. The author contrasts \"work energy\" from solar panels with the inefficiency of \"heat energy\" from fossil fuels, highlighting the advantages of electric vehicles and heat pumps.\n\nDespite the progress, the article acknowledges the backlash against clean energy in the US, exemplified by attempts to repeal tax credits for solar panels and EVs. However, the author sees this as a recognition of the disruptive potential of renewable energy. The invention of the photovoltaic cell in 1954 marked the beginning of this transformative era, driven by cost reductions and the increasing awareness of climate change.\n",

    "summary": "Derek Thompson's article, \"The Death of Partying in the U.S.A.—and Why It Matters,\" explores the significant decline in social gatherings in America over the past two decades. The article cites data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), revealing that young people aged 15-24 spend 70% less time partying than they did in 2003, and Americans, in general, have halved their social calendar. This decline is part of a broader trend of increasing solitude, which Thompson calls \"The Anti-Social Century.\"\n\nThe author traces the historical context of American socializing, noting a decline since the 1970s. He attributes the death of partying to several factors: the rise of dual-earner households, particularly women entering the workforce and not being replaced in the role of social calendar keeper by the men in the household, more intensive parenting practices, and the pervasive influence of screens and digital technology. While smartphones connect people to inner circles and online tribes, they often come at the expense of \"middle ring\" community and real-life interactions, fostering parasocial relationships over actual ones. The article also notes the decline in alcohol consumption among young people, which may contribute to less socializing.\n\nThompson concludes by cautioning that while progress and abundance are desirable, they can come with unforeseen costs, such as the erosion of social lives and the rise of anxiety and the decline of close relationships. He argues that society needs to be mindful of the trade-offs associated with technological advancements and prioritize genuine human connection.\n",

    "summary": "Clara Collier's article explores the surprising origin of the research university in 19th-century Germany, contrasting it with the traditional role of universities as primarily teaching institutions for producing priests, lawyers, and doctors. Before this transformation, true scholarship occurred outside of universities, in institutions like the British Royal Society.\n\nGerman universities, initially dysfunctional and focused on medieval curricula, underwent a significant shift. They began combining teaching with research, driven by a desire for usefulness and modernization. Early attempts at reform were heavily influenced by cameralism, a focus on public administration that aimed to make universities efficient and beneficial to the state, often through state control and the promotion of publication for fame and student attraction, rather than genuine research.\n\nThe University of Göttingen emerged as a key player, pioneering the concept of rewarding academic advancement through publication records, championed by Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen. This emphasis on publication, although initially about resume building, laid the foundation for a research culture. The article defines \"research\" as original scholarship that contributes to a broader scholarly dialogue and provides a basis for further investigation.\n\nImmanuel Kant's concept of \"Wissenschaft,\" or \"systematic knowledge,\" further shaped the research university. Kant advocated for the independence of the philosophy faculty and emphasized the importance of pursuing truth in a structured manner, contributing to the development of a system where original scholarship was not only valued but institutionalized.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses new research challenging the long-held belief that Rapa Nui (Easter Island) developed in isolation after its initial settlement. Using radiocarbon dating and archaeological analysis of ritual spaces and monuments across East Polynesia, Professors Wallin and Martinsson-Wallin argue that interaction networks between islands were more robust and that ritual ideas spread in both directions.\n\nThe study identifies three phases of ritual activity. The first, associated with the initial westward-to-eastward migration, involved burial and feasting rituals indicated by stone uprights. The second phase saw the development of \"marae,\" rectangular ritual spaces. Radiocarbon dating suggests the concept of visible ritual spaces originated in Rapa Nui and spread westward back into central East Polynesia. The final phase involved increased isolation, leading to independent development and the construction of monumental structures like the Moai on Rapa Nui as hierarchical societies evolved.\n\nThe research highlights that while initial colonization occurred from west to east, the development and spread of ritual practices were more complex. The study shows that innovative ritual practices, like the development of elaborate marae, originated in Rapa Nui and then influenced other islands in East Polynesia. This challenges the previously held view of a one-way cultural flow and reinforces the idea that interaction networks between islands played a significant role in shaping Polynesian culture.\n",

    "summary": "This article examines the increasingly common practice of renewable energy developers offering community benefit schemes to smooth the path for new projects and addresses the potential for these schemes to be perceived as bribes rather than genuine community support.\n\nThe authors outline the three main types of schemes: community funds, in-kind benefits, and local ownership models and explain the intended purpose is to offset the impact on locals, distribute economic benefits more fairly, and increase community acceptance.\n\nHowever, the article cautions that poorly designed schemes can resemble bribery, influencing community members to overlook their civic obligations to make public-spirited decisions. This can lead to a backlash and undermine the project's legitimacy.\n\nTo avoid this, the authors propose four key aims for designing community benefit schemes: minimize self-interest by focusing on in-kind benefits, respect the community through local employment and transparent communication, encourage community involvement through genuine consultation, and ensure integrity by making development and implementation of any scheme genuine, transparent and accountable.\n\nIn conclusion, the article argues that while community benefit schemes are vital for the clean energy transition, they must be designed carefully and with local input to avoid being perceived as bribes and to ensure both climate action and civic legitimacy are upheld.\n",

    "summary": "A large-scale DNA study, published in Nature, has mapped 37,000 years of human disease history, revealing the significant impact of human-animal interactions and migrations on the spread of infectious diseases. Analyzing DNA from over 1,300 prehistoric humans, researchers found the earliest evidence of zoonotic diseases dating back approximately 6,500 years, becoming more prevalent around 5,000 years ago. This increase coincided with a migration from the Pontic Steppe to north-western Europe by the Yamnaya herders.\n\nThe study identified the world's oldest genetic trace of the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) in a 5,500-year-old sample, alongside other diseases like malaria, leprosy, Hepatitis B, and diphtheria, dating back millennia. The findings support the theory that the transition to farming and animal husbandry led to a new era of disease.\n\nLed by Professor Eske Willerslev, the research highlights how past infections likely contributed to population changes and genetic adaptations. Associate Professor Martin Sikora emphasizes the importance of understanding past disease patterns to prepare for future outbreaks, as many emerging infectious diseases originate from animals.

    "url": "https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/general/configuring-pihole-to-serve-different-records-to-different-clients.html",
    "summary": "This article details how the author configured split horizon DNS using Pi-hole and Tailscale to provide secure and convenient access to internal services while away from their home network.\n\nThe author had previously used a reverse proxy with authentication to protect services from WAN access, but some services, like Nextcloud, lacked the ability to enforce additional authentication. To address this, and mitigate attack surface after attempted compromises, they implemented split horizon DNS.\n\nThe goal was for tailnet clients to resolve specific DNS names to tailnet IPs, while LAN clients would resolve to LAN IPs. This leverages Pi-hole's underlying `dnsmasq` functionality, which, with the `localise-queries` setting enabled, returns addresses based on the interface the query is received on.\n\nThe implementation involved converting DNS records to the `/etc/pihole/custom.list` format and reconfiguring the Pi-hole Docker container to use host networking. This allows Pi-hole to see the actual interface from which DNS queries originate. Initially, this caused DNS resolution failures due to Pi-hole being configured to only listen on interface `eth0`, which didn't exist. This was resolved by allowing queries from all origins in the Pi-hole web interface.\n\nFinally, the author disabled the previous route advertisement in Tailscale and enabled split DNS in the Tailscale admin panel, ensuring clients could resolve the targeted domain names to the appropriate IP address based on their location on the LAN or Tailnet. The result is a secure and seamless access to services, regardless of whether the client is on the LAN or connected remotely via Tailscale.\n",

    "url": "https://paolino.me/async-ruby-is-the-future/",
    "summary": "This article argues that async Ruby is superior to Python's async implementation, especially for AI applications, particularly those involving LLMs. The author, a former Python ML engineer, initially found Ruby's reliance on threads outdated, but discovered that its fiber-based async ecosystem, built by Samuel Williams and others, offers significant advantages.\n\nLLM communication, with its long-lived connections, streaming responses, and high concurrency demands, exposes the limitations of thread-based concurrency, leading to slot starvation, resource multiplication, performance overhead, and scalability challenges.\n\nThe article contrasts threads (preemptive multitasking, OS-managed) with fibers (cooperative concurrency, userspace-managed). Ruby's Global VM Lock (GVL) makes fibers particularly effective for I/O-bound operations. Fibers offer faster allocation, context switching, and higher throughput than threads, along with improved scalability due to efficient resource sharing and I/O multiplexing.\n\nRuby's async implementation is transparent, requiring no syntax changes or library migrations. RubyLLM, for example, automatically gains async performance by leveraging Net::HTTP within an Async block. The article highlights the `async` gem and its ecosystem, including Falcon, async-job, and async-cable. Migrating a Rails app to async is straightforward, requiring minimal configuration changes.\n\nAsync is best suited for I/O-bound operations like API calls and streaming, while threads are still appropriate for CPU-intensive tasks or legacy C extensions. The author believes Ruby's approach avoids the fragmentation and complexity seen in Python's async adoption, providing a competitive advantage for AI application development through lower costs, better performance, and simpler operations without codebase changes.\n",
    "chinese_title": "异步 Ruby 是 AI 应用的未来（它已到来）",
    "chinese_summary": "本文认为，异步Ruby优于Python的异步实现，尤其是在AI应用方面，特别是涉及LLM的应用。作者是一位前Python机器学习工程师，最初认为Ruby对线程的依赖已经过时，但后来发现由Samuel Williams等人构建的基于fiber的异步生态系统具有显著优势。\n\nLLM通信具有长连接、流式响应和高并发需求，这暴露了基于线程的并发的局限性，导致了时隙饥饿、资源倍增、性能开销和可扩展性挑战。\n\n本文将线程（抢占式多任务，由操作系统管理）与fiber（协同并发，由用户空间管理）进行了对比。Ruby的全局VM锁（GVL）使得fiber对于I/O密集型操作特别有效。与线程相比，Fiber提供更快的分配、上下文切换和更高的吞吐量，并且由于高效的资源共享和I/O多路复用而提高了可扩展性。\n\nRuby的异步实现是透明的，无需语法更改或库迁移。例如，RubyLLM通过利用Async块中的Net::HTTP，自动获得异步性能。本文重点介绍了`async` gem及其生态系统，包括Falcon、async-job和async-cable。将Rails应用程序迁移到异步非常简单，只需进行最少的配置更改。\n\nAsync最适合I/O密集型操作，如API调用和流式传输，而线程仍然适用于CPU密集型任务或遗留C扩展。作者认为，Ruby的方法避免了Python异步采用中出现的分裂和复杂性，通过更低的成本、更好的性能和更简单的操作（无需更改代码库）为AI应用程序开发提供了竞争优势。"

    "summary": "This Universe Today article explores the feasibility of a paper airplane surviving reentry from the International Space Station (ISS). Researchers at the University of Tokyo, Maximilien Berthet and Kojiro Suzuki, modeled the dynamics of an origami space plane made from a standard A4 sheet of paper.\n\nTheir simulations showed that a paper airplane launched from the ISS at 7800 meters/second would remain relatively stable in the thin atmosphere between 400 km and 120 km altitude, descending to 120 km in about 3.5 days due to its low ballistic coefficient. However, upon reaching the denser atmosphere around 120 km, the plane would experience uncontrollable tumbling, preventing a stable descent.\n\nTo further investigate, the researchers subjected a one-third scale model of the paper airplane (with an aluminum tail) to Mach 7 winds in a hypersonic wind tunnel, simulating reentry conditions for seven seconds. While the plane didn't disintegrate, the nose bent back and showed signs of charring, suggesting it would eventually burn up.\n\nThe experiment, while not resulting in a surviving paper airplane, highlights the potential for using lightweight, stable platforms for missions like the LEAVES Venus exploration or Earth observations, designed to burn up completely at the end of their operational life. The research blends inspiration and exploration, demonstrating the possibilities of simple designs for complex applications.\n",

    "summary": "This Tedium article explores ten early desktop publishing (DTP) software programs that have faded from memory, despite DTP's significant impact on the computing industry and the creation of new businesses.\n\nThe list begins with the **Xerox Alto**, arguing that its capabilities foreshadowed DTP, citing its typography and document layout tools. Next, **The Book Machine**, a dedicated typesetting computer, is discussed, highlighting its high cost and niche audience. Then, **MacPublisher**, an early Mac DTP tool predating PageMaker, is mentioned alongside its inventor, Bob Doyle. **Aldus PageMaker**, a hugely successful and industry-defining application, is included as an example of software that was eventually superseded.\n\nThe article also covers more consumer-oriented options like **The Newsroom**, aimed at creating printable newspapers for kids, and **Clickart Personal Publisher**, one of the first PC-centric DTP applications. Then, the relatively sophisticated **geoPublish**, for Commodore 64 and Apple II, is presented. **Ventura Publisher**, notable for its style sheets and XML-like document codes, is examined, as well as **Timeworks Publisher**, appearing on various platforms and struggling with kerning. Finally, **Serif PagePlus**, is mentioned, setting the stage for its successor Affinity Publisher.\n\nThe article ultimately highlights the evolution of DTP software, showcasing the diverse range of tools that emerged during its early days, many of which paved the way for the more sophisticated programs we use today.\n",

    "summary": "Microsoft is showcasing the financial benefits of its AI implementation, reporting over $500 million in savings in call centers alone last year. This comes amidst ongoing job cuts, with approximately 15,000 employees being laid off this year, including recent cuts in customer-facing roles. Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff emphasized that AI is boosting productivity across various departments, including sales, customer service, and software engineering. AI is now handling interactions with smaller customers, generating millions in revenue, and contributing to 35% of the code for new products, accelerating launch times.\n\nOther tech companies like Salesforce, Alphabet, and Meta are also leveraging AI to automate tasks and reduce hiring needs. While AI implementation fuels worker anxiety about job security, Althoff argued that AI can enhance the effectiveness of salespeople, citing that Copilot AI assistant helps salespersons find more leads, close deals faster and increase revenue by 9%. Despite the layoffs, Microsoft maintains that AI productivity gains were \"not a predominant factor\" in the recent job reductions, as stated by top lawyer Brad Smith. The company is also investing over $4 billion in cash and technology to promote AI skills in schools.\n",

    "summary": "This security advisory details a high-severity vulnerability in Helm, specifically affecting versions 3.18.3 and earlier. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-53547, allows for local code execution through a maliciously crafted `Chart.yaml` file and a specially linked `Chart.lock` file.\n\nThe core issue stems from the fact that fields in `Chart.yaml` are carried over to `Chart.lock` during dependency updates. An attacker can craft malicious content within `Chart.yaml` that, when written to `Chart.lock` via `helm dependency update`, can be executed if `Chart.lock` is symlinked to a file that gets executed (e.g., a shell script or `.bashrc`). Helm warns about the symlink but fails to prevent the execution.\n\nExploitation requires user interaction, as the user must execute `helm dependency update` on a chart with the malicious `Chart.yaml` and the symlinked `Chart.lock`. The attack vector is local, but a successful exploit can lead to high impact on integrity and availability. The scope is changed, indicating the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the immediately affected component.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Helm v3.18.4. As a workaround, users are advised to ensure the `Chart.lock` file is not a symlink before running `helm dependency update`. The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by Jakub Ciolek at AlphaSense.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores using the HyAB color distance formula with k-means clustering for color quantization to improve image quality. The author, Pekka Väänänen, details how HyAB, a hybrid distance combining absolute lightness difference and Euclidean chromaticity distance, aims to better represent large color differences compared to standard Euclidean distance in CIELAB space.\n\nThe author applies HyAB k-means to color quantization, finding a limited palette for an image and reconstructing it. He compares it to Pillow's quantize(), libimagequant, sRGB k-means, and pure CIELAB k-means. The results suggest HyAB provides better control over luminance-vs-color error and improved hue accuracy, especially in challenging colors like magenta and green.\n\nVäänänen also experiments with weighting the L-channel (luminance) in HyAB, finding it easier to control than similar adjustments in sRGB or CIELAB. He further modifies the k-means algorithm by using the median instead of the mean for calculating the L component of cluster centers, observing subtle improvements.\n\nThe article cautions that HyAB is not a magic bullet and that a well-rounded image compression system, including techniques like dithering and proper scaling, is crucial for optimal results. While HyAB can offer improvements in specific scenarios, particularly when dealing with large color differences or fixed palettes, it shouldn't replace comprehensive system tuning.\n",

By using the incredibly weak password \"123456\" for an administrator account, they gained access to a test account. This access allowed them to query databases containing as many as 64 million records of McDonald's job applicants, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThe researchers, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, were initially curious about McDonald's use of an AI chatbot for hiring and its potential for exploitation. They found they could manipulate applicant ID numbers to view the chat logs and personal information of other applicants.\n\nParadox.ai confirmed the findings, claiming that only a fraction of the records contained personal information and that the weak password had not been accessed by any other third party. They are implementing a bug bounty program in response. McDonald's blamed Paradox.ai for the \"unacceptable vulnerability\" and mandated immediate remediation.\n\nThe exposed data, combined with the knowledge that applicants were seeking employment at McDonald's, could create significant phishing risks.

They highlighted that the lack of a preliminary analysis deprived industry groups of adequate opportunity to contest the FTC's cost-benefit analysis and alternatives to the rule.\n\nThe FTC had argued that a preliminary analysis wasn't required later in the process and that any error was harmless, but the court disagreed, stating a separate preliminary analysis was mandated once the $100 million threshold was surpassed. Industry groups, including cable companies, sued the FTC, leading to the consolidated case heard by the 8th Circuit.\n\nRepublican FTC Commissioners opposed the rule from the outset, with one warning it might not survive legal challenges and accusing the majority of rushing the rule before the 2024 election.

    "summary": "This article details the author's journey into creating \"Explainable Minesweeper,\" a version of the classic game designed to teach players logical deduction rather than relying on luck. Inspired by the hints in \"14 Minesweeper Variants,\" the author realized many players, including themselves, often miss opportunities for deduction, particularly in ambiguous situations.\n\nThe core of \"Explainable Minesweeper\" lies in its map generation process. It generates random boards, then the AI attempts to solve them deductively from different starting points. Only boards solvable purely through deduction are kept. These boards are then slightly revealed by the AI to ease the starting difficulty.\n\nThe article outlines the deduction rules implemented in the game, which also serve as hints: Global Patterns (solving all mines or regular cells reveals the rest), Simple Patterns (flagging cells when neighbor count matches the cell's number, or revealing remaining cells when all flags are placed), and Advanced Patterns. The Advanced Patterns focus on comparing the number of mines needed in common and unique areas between two adjacent numbered cells, allowing for logical conclusions about whether those areas contain mines or are safe.\n\nThe author emphasizes that the logic behind these patterns is relatively simple and solvable with common sense, highlighting the potential for many players to improve their Minesweeper skills through understanding these deduction methods. The game supports multiple languages, and the author welcomes feedback and requests for additional language support. The key goal is to educate players and demonstrate that Minesweeper can be solved through logic, not just luck.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores why Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with writing code in q/kdb+, a language known for its right-to-left, no-operator-precedence (RL-NOP) evaluation order. The author argues that this evaluation order, while intentionally designed by APL creator Ken Iverson, presents a fundamental challenge for LLMs, as they are primarily trained to operate with left-to-right logic.\n\nThe author demonstrates that LLMs often produce a hybrid of Python and q code that is incorrect in both languages due to the RL-NOP rules of q. While LLMs can theoretically read code right-to-left for translation, they struggle to *write* code in that manner.\n\nThe article then explains why fixing this inherent limitation in LLMs is unlikely due to the niche nature of q/kdb+ and the lack of sufficient training data. Furthermore, altering LLM architectures for reverse temporal order might negatively impact their performance in other areas.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, the author proposes \"Qython,\" a Python-like language that compiles directly into q/kdb+. By leveraging LLMs' proficiency in Python, Qython allows developers to write code in a familiar syntax, while a translator handles the conversion to q's RL-NOP structure. A proof-of-concept using an updated q-MCP server with Qython support demonstrates successful generation of functional q code. Finally, the author suggests the need for a future q→Qython translator, acknowledging the complexities involved.\n",

    "summary": "This article delves into CPU branch instructions, crucial for program decision-making and performance. It explains the sequential execution model, where instructions are executed one after another, unless a branch instruction redirects the control flow.\n\nBranches are categorized as conditional (taken only if a condition is met) or unconditional (always taken). Conditional branches rely on CPU flags or comparisons to determine their direction. Branches can also be direct (target address encoded in the instruction) or indirect (target determined by a register or memory location).\n\nThe article highlights the importance of branch prediction, where the CPU guesses whether a branch will be taken and fetches the next instruction accordingly. Correct predictions enhance performance, while mispredictions lead to wasted effort. Branch prediction is effective because branches tend to be predictable, especially in loops.\n\nHowever, frequent branching, even when predicted correctly, can be expensive. Optimization strategies include simplifying if statement and loop conditions, ensuring inlining of suitable functions to eliminate call/return branches, avoiding excessive function call depth to prevent return address stack overflows, and minimizing indirect branches (often related to C++ inheritance and function pointers).

    "chinese_summary": "本文深入探讨CPU分支指令，这些指令对于程序决策和性能至关重要。文章解释了顺序执行模型，即指令一个接一个地执行，除非分支指令重定向控制流。\n\n分支分为条件分支（仅当满足条件时才执行）和无条件分支（总是执行）。条件分支依赖于CPU标志或比较来确定其方向。分支也可以是直接分支（目标地址编码在指令中）或间接分支（目标地址由寄存器或内存位置确定）。\n\n本文强调了分支预测的重要性，CPU会猜测分支是否会被执行，并相应地获取下一条指令。正确的预测可以提高性能，而错误的预测会导致浪费精力。分支预测是有效的，因为分支往往是可预测的，尤其是在循环中。\n\n然而，即使正确预测，频繁的分支也可能代价高昂。优化策略包括简化if语句和循环条件，确保内联合适的函数以消除调用/返回分支，避免过度的函数调用深度以防止返回地址栈溢出，以及最小化间接分支（通常与C++继承和函数指针相关）。本文强调了代码灵活性与某些编程结构相关的性能成本之间的权衡。"

    "summary": "The article, titled \"I Ported SAP to a 1976 CPU. It Wasn't That Slow,\" is about a user named oisee (or perhaps their project name) porting SAP (Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing) to a 1976 CPU, likely an older 8-bit processor. The repository is publicly available under the username zvdb-z80. The unexpected outcome is that the implementation wasn't as slow as one might anticipate, suggesting optimization or a specific subset of SAP functionality was implemented. The article highlights the surprise that a modern, complex software suite like SAP could function, even minimally, on such antiquated hardware. The repository has gained a modest amount of attention, indicated by the 2 forks and 34 stars. The core takeaway is the feasibility and potentially surprising performance of running SAP (or a version of it) on a 1970s CPU.\n",

RLS is particularly useful for multi-tenancy and multi-region scenarios.\n\nFor multi-tenancy, RLS enables data isolation in shared tables, reducing infrastructure costs and operational complexity compared to separate databases/schemas per tenant. The article demonstrates how to implement RLS using session variables to control tenant data visibility without modifying application queries.\n\nIn multi-region deployments, RLS complements CockroachDB's Regional by Row (RBR) feature, allowing data residency and access control based on geographic location. The article shows how to combine RBR and RLS to restrict user access based on their connection region, ensuring compliance with data residency laws like GDPR. Users connected in US-east1 will only see data from us-east1 and so on.\n\nThe article emphasizes that CockroachDB's RLS provides a powerful, built-in mechanism for enforcing fine-grained access control directly within the database, scaling securely and efficiently without extensive application changes.
