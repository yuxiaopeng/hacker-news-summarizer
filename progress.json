    "summary": "The article, as represented by the title and quoted text, revolves around the idea that \"Suspicionless ChatControl\" should be considered taboo in a state governed by the rule of law. Patrick Breyer's post on Mastodon (as indicated by the link to digitalcourage.social) references Germany's Minister of Justice and the concept of \"Suspicion...\", suggesting a discussion about the legality and ethics of monitoring digital communications without prior suspicion.\n\nThe core issue is the potential conflict between mass surveillance of private communications (ChatControl) and the principles of a rule-of-law state, which prioritize individual rights and freedoms. Suspicionless ChatControl implies blanket monitoring of citizens' digital interactions without any reasonable cause, potentially violating privacy and freedom of expression.\n\nThe context of the post being shared on Mastodon, a decentralized and privacy-focused social media platform, further emphasizes the concern about digital surveillance. The note about requiring JavaScript to use the web application also indirectly highlights the reliance on technology for communication and the potential vulnerabilities associated with it.\n\nIn essence, the article and linked post raise concerns about the erosion of privacy and the potential for abuse of power when governments implement surveillance measures without reasonable suspicion, arguing that such practices are incompatible with a state governed by the rule of law.\n",

    "summary": "This article details Cloudflare's investigation into a sporadic panic affecting their arm64 infrastructure. Initially dismissed as rare stack memory corruption, the panics persisted and intensified, leading to a deeper investigation. The errors manifested as crashes during stack unwinding, specifically within `(*unwinder).next`, stemming from a fatal error indicating incomplete unwinding or segmentation faults due to invalid memory access.\n\nThrough analyzing coredumps, the team identified that the crashes consistently occurred during the preemption of the `(*NetlinkSocket).Receive` function from the `Go Netlink` library. This preemption was happening during the function's epilogue, specifically between two stack pointer adjustments. The inconsistent stack state during preemption caused the stack unwinder to read an invalid stack pointer, leading to the crash.\n\nTo confirm their hypothesis, they developed a minimal reproducer, a simple Go program that creates a large stack frame that requires splitting the stack pointer adjustment into two operations on arm64. This program reliably triggered the panic, confirming that the issue was a Go runtime bug related to async preemption during specific stack operations. The bug occurs when the Go runtime preempts between these opcodes then the stack unwinder will read an invalid stack pointer and crash.\n",

He argues that regulators, often starved of resources due to deregulation, are unable to effectively oversee these tech giants.\n\nHe provides examples, like Uber's classification of drivers, Airbnb's impact on the housing market, and financial technology (fintech) platforms, to illustrate how companies use apps to obscure illegal activities, such as ignoring labor laws, usury laws, and price-fixing. He also mentions Plexure, which sells surveillance data that vendors use to raise prices, and RealPage, which offers rent recommendations to landlords.\n\nDoctorow also points out that intellectual property laws are being used to prevent users and competitors from modifying or \"disenshittifying\" problematic apps, further solidifying the power of these tech cartels. He contends that tech companies not only claim immunity from laws due to their use of apps but also criminalize attempts to fix these apps to protect users. The core of his argument is that the complexity afforded by apps allows these companies to operate beyond the reach of existing regulations.\n",

    "summary": "Synology has reversed its controversial policy that restricted the use of third-party hard drives in its newer NAS models, a move prompted by plummeting sales after the policy's introduction. Earlier in 2025, Synology implemented a policy forcing users to buy its own, more expensive HDDs, making third-party drives from brands like Seagate and WD practically unusable. This sparked immediate backlash from users and reviewers who criticized the move as greedy and a customer lock-in attempt.\n\nSales of Synology's 2025 NAS models reportedly dropped sharply following the restriction. With the release of DSM 7.3, Synology quietly restored support for third-party hard drives and 2.5-inch SATA SSDs. Drives from Seagate, WD, and others now function as they did before, with full monitoring, alerts, and storage features.\n\nWhile Synology hasn't explicitly admitted fault, the decision is seen as a response to sales pressure and community outrage. Critics argue that the episode has damaged Synology's reputation, as many users have turned to alternative brands or are hesitant to purchase another Synology product. The return of open drive support is viewed as a positive development, restoring the flexibility that initially made Synology popular. Whether this reversal is enough to regain the trust of frustrated users remains to be seen.\n",

It leverages the bitwise OR operator (`|`) and `Symbol.toPrimitive` for coercion, creating a deferred, asynchronous-safe, and stateless pipeline.\n\nThe project defines `createAsPipes()` which returns `pipe()` to start a pipeline with an initial value and `asPipe()` to wrap functions, making them pipeable. Transformations are registered and evaluated sequentially when `.run()` is called, returning a Promise of the final result. The implementation is small (under 50 lines) and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n\nExamples demonstrate string manipulation, numeric calculations, asynchronous API calls (LLM integration), and composable (higher-order) pipes for creating reusable workflows. Stream processing with async generators is also supported, enabling functional reactive programming patterns.\n\nThe article emphasizes that asPipes prototypes F#-style semantics directly in JavaScript, facilitating ergonomic study and informing the design of the `|>` proposal with practical feedback. While it has limitations (only pipeable tokens on the right-hand side, potential for tooling confusion) and is not intended for production use, it serves as a demonstration of JavaScript's flexibility and encourages discussion on deferred evaluation models, static analysis, TypeScript integration, and the explicit vs. implicit nature of the `.run()` method for the official `|>` operator.\n",

Analyzing over 1,000 batteries, the study found that nearly 8% of low-cost or counterfeit batteries from online retailers like Amazon and Temu exhibited a dangerous manufacturing defect called negative anode overhang, which significantly increases the risk of internal short-circuiting, fires, and reduced battery life.  \n\nCounterfeit batteries also often had overinflated capacity specifications (e.g., 9,900 mAh compared to the standard 3,000-3,450 mAh of reputable brands) and performed poorly in real-world tests, demonstrating capacities below 1,300 mAh. In contrast, batteries from established OEMs like Samsung and Panasonic sourced from specialized suppliers showed no defects. Rewrap batteries, while generally performing well, presented a risk due to uncertain sourcing and potential lack of quality control.  The study underscores the potential dangers of opting for cheaper, less-known battery brands, suggesting that investing in reputable brands can significantly reduce the risk of battery-related incidents.\n",

    "summary": "Oscar Molnar details a frustrating debugging experience where IntelliJ IDEA failed to connect to an Ollama instance accessible via both a Traefik-proxied HTTPS endpoint and a direct HTTP endpoint, despite `curl` working flawlessly in both scenarios. The initial \"Test Connection\" button in IntelliJ yielded only a generic \"Failed to connect\" error.\n\nHe initially suspected HTTPS incompatibility within IntelliJ or permission issues. After ruling out HTTPS limitations, macOS local network permissions, and firewall problems, he investigated IntelliJ's logs. The logs revealed a `java.net.ConnectException: No route to host` error specifically during the direct HTTP connection attempt.\n\nThe root cause was identified as the JVM attempting an IPv6 connection (which failed due to a lack of IPv6 configuration on the LAN) before falling back to IPv4, leading to the connection failure. The fix involved adding the JVM option `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true` to IntelliJ's custom VM options. This forces the JVM to prioritize IPv4, resolving the connection issue.\n\nMolnar highlights the importance of checking logs when faced with discrepancies between `curl` and Java-based IDE connectivity, suggesting IPv6 preference issues as a potential culprit before more drastic troubleshooting steps are taken.\n",

    "url": "http://bannalia.blogspot.com/2025/10/bulk-operations-in-boostbloom.html",
    "summary": "This article discusses the introduction of bulk operations in Boost.Bloom starting with version 1.90, designed to significantly improve insertion and lookup speeds in Bloom filters. The core optimization involves separating the calculation of positions within the Bloom filter's array from the actual memory access, leveraging prefetching to minimize CPU stalling caused by accessing uncached memory.\n\nThe article highlights the algorithmic challenges, particularly for lookup operations with `k > 1`, where the traditional non-bulk approach is branchful and difficult to pipeline. A naive bulk implementation suffers from excessive conditional branching that hurts performance. Boost.Bloom's solution uses a bitmask to track which positions still need evaluation, using `std::countr_zero` to efficiently skip terminated columns and reducing unnecessary iterations. This minimizes both branching and superfluous memory fetches.\n\nPerformance benchmarks for lookup operations on a filter with 10M elements show speedups of up to 3x using bulk operations, although the exact improvement depends on factors like filter configuration, size, and access patterns. The optimization strategy of iteration reduction with `std::countr_zero` can be applied in other contexts to enhance pipelining of early-exit operations. The article concludes that while performance gains can be substantial, the impact varies and sometimes might even result in less performance than the regular case.\n",
    "chinese_title": "Boost.Bloom 中的批量操作",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了 Boost.Bloom 从 1.90 版本开始引入批量操作，旨在显著提高 Bloom 过滤器中插入和查找的速度。 核心优化包括将 Bloom 过滤器数组中位置的计算与实际内存访问分离，利用预取来最大限度地减少因访问未缓存内存而导致的 CPU 停顿。\n\n本文重点介绍了算法方面的挑战，特别是对于 `k > 1` 的查找操作，传统的非批量方法分支较多且难以流水线化。一个简单的批量实现会受到过度条件分支的影响，从而损害性能。 Boost.Bloom 的解决方案使用位掩码来跟踪哪些位置仍需要评估，使用 `std::countr_zero` 来有效跳过已终止的列，并减少不必要的迭代。这最大限度地减少了分支和多余的内存提取。\n\n对具有 1000 万个元素的过滤器进行查找操作的性能基准测试表明，使用批量操作可以提高高达 3 倍的速度，尽管确切的改进取决于过滤器配置、大小和访问模式等因素。使用 `std::countr_zero` 减少迭代的优化策略可以应用于其他环境，以增强提前退出操作的流水线处理。文章总结说，虽然性能提升可能很大，但影响各不相同，有时甚至可能导致比常规情况下的性能更低。"

    "summary": "John Allen Paulos explores the paradoxical nature of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that stock prices reflect all available information. He traces the idea back to Louis Bachelier and highlights the different strengths of the hypothesis, from reflecting past prices to incorporating all information, even insider knowledge.\n\nThe paradox arises because the EMH's truth hinges on investor beliefs. If most investors believe the market is efficient, they won't actively seek undervalued stocks, leading to inefficiencies. Conversely, if most investors believe the market is inefficient, their efforts to find an edge will drive prices towards efficiency. Therefore, the EMH is arguably true only when a sufficient number of investors disbelieve it.\n\nPaulos acknowledges the oversimplifications in his argument, such as defining \"sufficiently large\" investor groups and the possibility of pricing model errors. He also recognizes the psychological barrier of accepting the EMH, as it undermines the investor's self-image as a skilled market strategist.\n\nUltimately, Paulos concludes that the EMH likely holds, but only approximately and most of the time, due to the prevailing disbelief among investors. He draws a parallel to baseball, where the disappearance of .400 hitters is attributed to the overall improvement of all players, creating a more \"efficient\" market within the sport. He suggests the EMH could even apply to prediction markets, which become more efficient as an event nears.\n",

This allows engineers to tackle more complex problems and run multiple agents in parallel.\n\nThe article emphasizes that effective use of LLMs rewards established software engineering practices like automated testing, advance planning, comprehensive documentation, good version control, effective automation, code review, and strong QA. It also touches on the need for a \"weird form of management\" when working with coding agents, as well as strong research skills, preview environments, and updated estimation skills.\n\nThe author acknowledges that \"vibe engineering\" is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek term, but argues it's necessary to differentiate the more disciplined and demanding approach from the casual \"vibe coding\".

The hearing, held shortly before a government shutdown, examined the potential misuse of traveler surveillance programs regardless of political leadership.\n\nThe article highlights concerns that these programs, like Quiet Skies, which assigned Federal Air Marshals to surveil pre-selected airline passengers, target individuals based on factors like ethnicity, travel history, and even protected First Amendment activities. Examples include individuals who used credit cards near the Capitol on January 6th and critics of Israeli military actions.\n\nWhile the Quiet Skies program was ended by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noehm, and officials associated with it were fired, the article questions the TSA's authority to prevent travel or surveil individuals without judicial oversight. It emphasizes the bipartisan nature of the problem, quoting the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) highlighting that government can tag any group depending on who holds power.\n\nThe article advocates for a clear legal right to travel, citing ongoing court cases challenging no-fly lists and the government's argument that travel delays are insufficient harm.

Wasp prioritizes well-designed, readable tests mirroring the care given to production code. They use descriptive tests, sometimes employing custom DSLs for clarity, and value \"courage\" (confidence in catching errors) over aiming for 100% coverage. They favor \"Type-Driven Development\" over traditional TDD, leveraging strong typing for guidance.\n\nTesting the compiler itself involves unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests. Snapshot tests are crucial for tracking code generation changes, comparing current compiler output with golden snapshots stored in Git.\n\nWasp addresses challenges of Mustache templates (used for code generation) breaking TypeScript tooling by migrating TypeScript logic into npm packages. Runtime testing of Wasp apps, including starter templates and example apps, is done with Playwright e2e tests. The \"kitchen-sink\" app, a comprehensive example, tests many framework features and is included in snapshot tests.\n\nTo simplify test automation, Wasp developed `wasp-app-runner`, a tool with `dev` and `build` commands. Deployment testing involves automated deployment and smoke tests of the kitchen-sink app on each code merge and all example apps on each release.\n\nFinally, Wasp is integrating documentation testing by referencing code examples directly from example apps, ensuring examples remain up-to-date and forcing feature testing. They are implementing this via a Docusaurus plugin called `code-ref-checker`. The article showcases how they ensure tutorials remain valid by testing them before each release.\n",

    "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63417-y",
    "summary": "This article presents evidence of human occupation in the Nefud Desert of northern Arabia during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (approximately 16,000 to 11,400 years ago), a period previously thought to be largely uninhabited due to extreme aridity. The research team discovered that playas (seasonal water bodies) became established in the region between ~16 and ~13 ka, providing fresh water sources that facilitated human expansion.\n\nExcavations of stratified archaeological sites dating to between 12.8 and 11.4 ka revealed that these early human populations exploited a network of these seasonal water bodies. They marked important locations and access routes with monumental rock engravings of animals such as camels, ibex, equids, gazelles, and aurochs.\n\nThe rock art, comprising life-sized and naturalistic depictions, was categorized into four phases, with the earliest phases showing stylized depictions of women followed by larger human figures. Later phases displayed detailed animal representations, transitioning to more stylized depictions with cartoonish features over time.\n\nLuminescence dating of playa sediments supports the establishment of surface water in the region starting around 16 ka at JMI and 13 ka at ARN, indicating a shift towards more humid conditions following the Last Glacial Maximum. The researchers concluded that the rock art panels and associated archaeological deposits signify a longer period of human presence in northern Arabia than previously understood, demonstrating human adaptation to a changing environment. Moreover, the stone tool types found at the sites suggest ongoing connections to late Epipalaeolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic populations of the Levant.\n",

    "summary": "This Scientific American article discusses recent breakthroughs in understanding the seemingly random distribution of prime numbers by connecting them to fractal chaos. For centuries, mathematicians have sought patterns in prime numbers, which are only divisible by themselves and 1. The article highlights the significance of the Riemann zeta function, a tool that helps to estimate and correct for irregularities in the distribution of primes. The Riemann Hypothesis, which posits that all the zeros of the zeta function lie on a specific line, remains unproven and is a major focus of research.\n\nRecent research has revealed that the distribution of large sets of prime numbers statistically resembles certain types of random sequences, leading to the use of \"random measures\" as tools for understanding their behavior. A key discovery was the similarity between the spacing of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the energy levels of heavy atomic nuclei.\n\nMore recently, mathematicians have found a connection between the primes and Gaussian multiplicative chaos, a type of randomness found in chaotic systems and fractals. Adam Harper proved that this type of fractal randomness can be used to describe statistics associated with the zeros of the zeta function. Furthermore, Harper, Xu, and Soundararajan discovered how to predict when chaotic behavior emerges in collections of prime numbers. This work even led to a new way to count prime numbers in short intervals, surpassing Riemann's original equation, though it relies on a conjecture from physics.\n\nWhile these discoveries do not make the primes deterministic, they offer new insights into the underlying patterns and statistical behavior of these fundamental mathematical \"atoms.\" Mathematicians continue to explore the probabilistic patterns to understand the deeper meaning of the primes.\n",

    "summary": "This article applies James C. Scott's \"Seeing Like a State\" to software companies, arguing that the pursuit of legibility—making work measurable, reportable, and predictable—often comes at the expense of efficiency. While small companies thrive on illegible, engineer-driven work, large companies prioritize legibility to manage enterprise deals and facilitate long-term planning, even if it slows down development.\n\nLegibility in tech means knowing what projects are active, what has shipped, and being able to plan and direct resources. To achieve this, large companies make simplifying assumptions about engineers and projects, which, while often inaccurate, are \"true enough\" for planning and external communication.\n\nThe article also highlights the existence of both sanctioned and unsanctioned zones of illegibility within large companies. Sanctioned zones, like \"strike teams,\" are temporary solutions for urgent problems that bypass formal processes. Unsanctioned illegibility manifests as backchannels—informal communication and collaboration between engineers and teams—that circumvent slow, official channels. These backchannels are crucial for getting work done quickly, but they rely on interpersonal relationships and are difficult for companies to quantify or control. The author asserts that these unofficial channels are vital to the functioning of the official, legible processes.\n",

The author starts by revisiting Gaussian elimination, a method for solving systems of linear equations (demonstrated with nickels and pennies, then milk and bread).\n\nThe \"row picture\" visualizes each equation as a line on a graph, where the solution is the intersection point representing the combination of bread and milk that satisfies both equations.\n\nThe \"column picture\" introduces vectors and a single vector equation. It reinterprets the problem as finding the right amount of milk and bread vectors to \"add up\" to a target vector (representing the desired carbs and protein). This is visually represented by adding scaled vectors graphically. The article demonstrates the algebraic operations on vectors: scalar multiplication and vector addition, showing how it matches the food example.\n\nThe article concludes by introducing matrix notation as a compact way to represent the same system of equations. It emphasizes that this is the same system of equations described in both the row and column pictures. The author teases future chapters that will delve into dot products and other concepts in linear algebra. The goal is to show that linear algebra works with arrays of numbers (vectors, matrices) instead of just numbers.\n",

Martinis for their groundbreaking experiments demonstrating quantum mechanical properties on a macroscopic scale using superconducting electrical circuits. Their work showed that the bizarre phenomenon of quantum tunneling, typically observed with single particles, can be witnessed in a system large enough to be held in the hand, involving billions of Cooper pairs behaving as a single quantum unit.\n\nThe laureates created a Josephson junction, two superconductors separated by a thin insulator, and demonstrated that this system could tunnel out of a zero-voltage state, generating an electrical voltage, despite classically lacking the energy to do so. They also showed that the system absorbed and emitted energy only in specific, quantized amounts, further solidifying its quantum nature.\n\nThis research builds upon earlier work on superconductivity and quantum tunneling, connecting microscopic phenomena like alpha decay and Cooper pairs to macroscopic observations. Their experiment offers a unique perspective because the quantum effects observed arise from a macroscopic state of many particles behaving collectively, unlike other macroscopic quantum phenomena built from individual microscopic components.\n\nTheir work provides a new \"artificial atom\" for experiments and quantum technologies, like quantum computing, where quantized energy levels are used as quantum bits. The findings have contributed to both practical applications in physics laboratories and a deeper theoretical understanding of the quantum world, drawing comparisons to Schrödinger's cat thought experiment to highlight the persistence of quantum properties at larger scales.\n",

    "summary": "\"Show HN: I'm building a browser for reverse engineers\" details the creation of a custom browser designed to aid in web reverse engineering, particularly in bypassing anti-bot measures. The author, veritas, initially aimed to create a Chrome extension to hook JavaScript functions like `Array.prototype.push` but encountered isolation issues with content scripts.\n\nUndeterred, they explored the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and successfully used `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` to inject hooks before a page's own scripts. This led to the development of an Electron-based browser with a UI that displayed hooked function events, revealing valuable telemetry from sites like TikTok.\n\nHowever, the project hit a snag with Cloudflare's Turnstile, which uses out-of-process iframes (OOPIFs) that prevented hooks from running. To overcome this, veritas leveraged the `Target.attachedToTarget` CDP event to dynamically attach to new frames and inject hooks into OOPIFs.\n\nThe author then encountered the issue of anti-bot techniques detecting JavaScript runtime patches (e.g., via `toString()`).

Originally classified as Homo erectus, scientists now believe the skull may belong to Homo longi (dragon man), a group closely related to the Denisovans.\n\nThis reclassification, based on advanced CT imaging and digital reconstruction, would push back the split between modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans by at least 400,000 years. This suggests our ancestors diversified into distinct groups much earlier than currently believed.\n\nThe study raises the possibility that the common ancestor of these groups, and potentially the first Homo sapiens, originated in western Asia instead of Africa. The analysis of a broader selection of fossils indicates that large-brained humans evolved along five major branches in the last 800,000 years: Asian erectus, heidelbergensis, sapiens, Neanderthals, and Homo longi (including the Denisovans).\n\nWhile this research offers a potential resolution to the complexities surrounding human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago, it contradicts some genetic analyses.

    "summary": "This article introduces the Tiny Recursion Model (TRM), a novel approach to recursive reasoning that achieves impressive results on the ARC-AGI benchmark using a surprisingly small 7M parameter neural network. The author argues against the prevailing trend of relying solely on massive, expensive foundational models for complex tasks, suggesting that innovation in reasoning mechanisms is crucial.\n\nTRM is inspired by, but simplifies, the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). It iteratively refines its answer to a given question through a recursive process. The model starts with an embedded question (x), an initial embedded answer (y), and a latent variable (z). For a set number of steps (K), the model improves 'y' by: 1) repeatedly updating the latent variable 'z' based on 'x', 'y', and the current 'z' (recursive reasoning), and 2) updating the answer 'y' based on the current 'y' and 'z'.\n\nThe core idea is that this iterative refinement allows the model to progressively correct errors and improve its answer in a highly parameter-efficient manner, minimizing overfitting. This approach demonstrates that small models, leveraging recursive reasoning, can achieve significant performance on challenging problems without requiring extensive resources. The author emphasizes that the model's effectiveness stems from a simplified approach to recursive reasoning, not biological analogies or complex mathematical frameworks.\n",

    "url": "https://centralflows.github.io/part1/",
    "summary": "This article explores how gradient descent, the simplest optimization algorithm, works in deep learning, challenging traditional analysis and presenting a new perspective.  Traditional analysis, based on quadratic approximations of the loss landscape, suggests gradient descent should stay within \"stable regions\" where the sharpness (largest eigenvalue of the Hessian) is less than 2/η (where η is the learning rate). If the sharpness exceeds this threshold, the quadratic approximation predicts divergence.\n\nHowever, experiments reveal that gradient descent in deep learning frequently exits this stable region. The sharpness rises until it hits the 2/η threshold, at which point oscillations along the top Hessian eigenvector begin, growing in magnitude and causing loss spikes.  Surprisingly, the sharpness then drops, oscillations shrink, and the loss decreases.  This phenomenon is termed \"training at the edge of stability (EOS).\"\n\nThe article introduces a third-order Taylor expansion to explain this behavior. The key insight is that oscillations along the top Hessian eigenvector automatically trigger a reduction in the top Hessian eigenvalue (sharpness). Specifically, the third-order term in the Taylor expansion reveals that each gradient step implicitly takes a negative gradient step on the sharpness, proportional to the squared magnitude of the oscillation. This creates a negative feedback mechanism: when sharpness exceeds 2/η, oscillations increase, which in turn reduces the sharpness, steering the process back towards the stable region. This EOS behavior is observed across various network architectures and datasets.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses the potential for significantly reducing aviation's climate impact by eliminating contrails, the white trails left by airplanes. While eliminating CO2 emissions from flying is expensive, addressing contrails could be surprisingly cheap and effective.\n\nContrails contribute to global warming by trapping outgoing radiation, an effect that is short-lived compared to CO2 emissions. A small percentage of flights (around 3-5%) are responsible for the majority (80%) of contrail warming. The solution proposed is to reroute these flights around regions of the atmosphere prone to contrail formation, typically requiring a detour of only about 1%, adding a few minutes to flight time.\n\nThe cost of implementing this rerouting is estimated to be very low, ranging from a few cents to around 50 cents per passenger, translating to a few dollars per tonne of CO2 equivalent avoided. This is significantly cheaper than sustainable aviation fuels.\n\nDespite the low cost and potential for a substantial climate impact reduction (potentially halving aviation's warming effect), airlines have been slow to adopt contrail avoidance. This reluctance is attributed to the overall cost across their fleets and, more importantly, a lack of public awareness, allowing airlines to avoid scrutiny. The article argues that government policy, such as mandating contrail avoidance or simply requiring airlines to report non-CO2 impacts, is needed to drive progress in this area.\n",

    "summary": "Richard Artoul argues against using Spark jobs or \"zero-copy\" Kafka implementations for building and maintaining Iceberg tables from real-time data in Kafka. He contends that these approaches are overly complex, inefficient, and ultimately unsatisfactory.\n\nSpark batch jobs require extensive code and result in high latency for table updates. Spark Streaming introduces the \"small file problem,\" necessitating compaction jobs, which then lead to the \"single writer problem,\" creating conflicts and performance issues. This results in complex, resource-intensive solutions that are difficult to manage.\n\nThe article then critiques the idea of Kafka itself building Iceberg tables through tiered storage. While seemingly convenient (\"zero-copy\"), it creates performance bottlenecks on Kafka brokers due to the CPU-intensive parquet file generation and introduces an impedance mismatch between Kafka and Iceberg partitioning strategies.  Ultimately, trying to combine operational and analytical workloads within Kafka compromises both. Compaction, still a necessity with this approach, becomes even more problematic within the Kafka infrastructure.\n\nArtoul advocates for a dedicated, \"iceberg-native\" database to handle the complexities of building and maintaining Iceberg tables. The article alludes to WarpStream's Tableflow as a solution to convert Kafka topic data into Iceberg tables efficiently and cheaply, keeping them compacted with low latency.\n",

The author recounts the journey, highlighting the successful execution of a simple Erlang function, `hello:start/2`, using JIT-compiled ARM32 machine code.\n\nThe `hello:start/2` function, designed to call the `erlang:halt/2` BIF with an exit code of 42, served as the initial test case. The post details the steps involved, including compiling the Erlang module, generating BEAM assembly, and utilizing `qemu-arm` for emulation.\n\nThe JIT's initialization process is explained, including the emission of shared code fragments and the `erts_beamasm` module, crucial for managing process execution. The author also mentions simplifying the build by focusing solely on the `hello.erl` module to facilitate debugging and verification. The use of `-JDdump true` for generating ARM32 assembly dumps is emphasized as essential for debugging.\n\nThe post then examines the generated assembly code, pointing out calls to \"Not Yet Implemented\" (NYI) functions and highlighting the Erlang function prologue's minimal implementation. The author identifies the location of the exit code 42 within the assembly, revealing it is stored as a tagged value (687) in register r4, which points to the ErtsSchedulerRegisters struct. The post concludes with optimism about future incremental additions of Erlang instructions to the JIT.\n",

Removing these objects could significantly reduce the risk of collisions that trigger a cascade of new debris, known as the Kessler Syndrome.\n\nThe study, led by Darren McKnight, highlights that most of the problematic debris was deposited before 2000, with Russia and China being the largest contributors. Removing the top 10 objects would decrease debris-generating potential by 30%, while removing all 50 would halve the risk.\n\nA troubling trend is the increasing number of rocket bodies abandoned in LEO after 2024, particularly by China during the deployment of its Guowang and Thousand Sails megaconstellations. These actions violate international guidelines requiring objects to deorbit within 25 years. While China possesses the technology to deorbit rockets, it doesn't consistently apply it, prioritizing rapid constellation deployment.\n\nWhile active debris removal is technically feasible, the lack of a viable market and questions about who pays hinder progress. Despite these challenges, the study suggests that removing even a small number of the most hazardous objects would create a measurable positive impact.\n",

    "url": "https://jacobsherin.com/posts/2025-08-18-bplustree-struct-hack/",
    "summary": "This article details a technique for creating cache-friendly B+Tree nodes with dynamic fanout in C++, focusing on achieving a contiguous memory layout for optimal performance. The challenge lies in needing variable-length arrays for node entries (determined at runtime) while avoiding the indirection introduced by `std::vector`.\n\nThe solution is the \"struct hack\" or \"flexible array member\" technique, standardized in C99/C++11. This involves declaring a dynamically sized array as the last member of a struct, allocating a single contiguous block of memory to hold both the struct's header and the array elements. Placement new is used to construct the object within the pre-allocated buffer.\n\nHowever, this approach introduces significant complexity. Memory management becomes manual, requiring careful allocation and deallocation to prevent leaks. Inheritance is restricted due to potential data corruption from derived class members overwriting the data buffer. Furthermore, it necessitates reimplementing functionality similar to `std::vector` and imposes hidden data type assumptions, as `std::memmove` requires trivially copyable types to avoid issues like double-frees when used with `std::string`.\n\nIn conclusion, while flexible array members provide the necessary contiguous memory layout for high-performance B+Trees with dynamic fanout, they come at the cost of increased implementation complexity, manual memory management, and limitations on inheritance and data types. The trade-off is worthwhile for performance-critical applications.\n",

Before the rats encountered a detour, their brains fired in patterns suggesting imagined alternate routes during sleep, which correlated with neural activity during the actual detour.\n\nDuring detour navigation, the rats' brains \"flickered\" between their current location and the memory of the original path, facilitated by theta brain waves. After the detour was removed, the brain didn't simply revert to the old map; instead, it created an updated representation incorporating the detour experience.\n\nThe lead author, Yuchen Zhou, noted that this \"pre-wiring\" allowed the rats to learn the detour quickly. Senior author George Dragoi suggests that this \"flickering\" mechanism, which enables quick comparison of current and remembered experiences, has broader implications. Disruptions in this mechanism could contribute to conditions like PTSD, where past and present memories become mixed, interfering with reality. The study highlights how the brain flexibly adapts its internal maps to navigate unexpected changes in our environment.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "耶鲁大学研究人员发现，大脑的“GPS”——海马体，如何修改认知地图来导航新的空间。该研究使用在迷宫中导航的老鼠，揭示大脑甚至在遇到不熟悉的路线之前就会“预演”它们。在老鼠遇到绕行路线之前，它们的大脑在睡眠期间会以暗示想象的替代路线的模式放电，这与实际绕行期间的神经活动相关。\n\n在绕行导航期间，老鼠的大脑会在其当前位置和原始路径的记忆之间“闪烁”，这由θ脑波促进。 绕行被移除后，大脑不会简单地恢复到旧地图；相反，它创建了一个包含绕行经历的更新后的表征。\n\n第一作者周宇辰指出，这种“预先连接”使老鼠能够快速学习绕行路线。资深作者乔治·德拉戈伊认为，这种“闪烁”机制能够快速比较当前和记忆中的经历，具有更广泛的意义。 这种机制的紊乱可能导致诸如创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）之类的疾病，在这些疾病中，过去和现在的记忆会混淆，从而干扰现实。 这项研究突显了大脑如何灵活地调整其内部地图，以应对环境中意外的变化。"

Bob Ross Inc. donated approximately 30 paintings, many created on his TV show \"The Joy of Painting\" in the 80s and 90s, to American Public Television. All net proceeds will go to local PBS and NPR stations struggling after Congress approved budget cuts.\n\nThe auction aims to continue Ross's legacy of bringing joy and creativity to American homes through public television. The funds will help support programs like \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics,\" and \"This Old House.\"\n\nThis follows the successful August auction of two of Ross's paintings, \"Lake Below Snow-Capped Peaks\" and \"Lake Below Snow-Covered Mountains,\" which sold for $114,800 and $95,750 respectively, far exceeding expectations. Bob Ross Inc. President Joan Kowalski believes Ross would have been surprised by the paintings' high value, as he was more passionate about the process of painting and inspiring others to create their own art. \"The Joy of Painting\" experienced a resurgence during the Covid pandemic, demonstrating Ross's enduring appeal.\n",

Bluesky, pitched as an open and user-friendly alternative to Twitter after Elon Musk's takeover, gained popularity due to its ease of use and flexible, user-driven content moderation. However, the platform has faced criticism regarding moderation decisions, particularly concerning anti-trans content and alleged tolerance of racist content.\n\nBluesky's ambitious goal is a federated Authenticated Transfer Protocol (ATProto) network, enabling independent instances. However, due to the complexity of Bluesky's software stack, true federation has not been achieved. Blacksky, an alternative service created in response to complaints about Bluesky's moderation, remains partially dependent on Bluesky's application server and moderation system.\n\nThe article focuses on a specific incident where a Blacksky user, Link, was banned by Bluesky, rendering his posts invisible even on Blacksky. This revealed the extent of Blacksky's reliance on Bluesky's infrastructure. The ban occurred after Link posted a reaction meme to a post from Bluesky CEO Jay Graber.\n\nThe situation highlights the limitations of Bluesky's current decentralization efforts. While developers are working on tools to simplify the creation of custom AppViews, alternatives like Blacksky are still dependent on the main platform.
