    "summary": "In this article, Casey Mock argues that Meta’s legal team has abandoned the foundational ethical standards of the American legal profession—balancing loyalty to the client with duties to the court and the country. Drawing a direct parallel to the \"Big Tobacco\" playbook of the 1970s, Mock asserts that Meta’s attorneys have prioritized corporate profit over public safety, specifically regarding the welfare of children.\n\nThe author details several instances of alleged misconduct:\n*   **Suppression of Research:** Meta’s \"Project Mercury\" found that reduced usage decreased teen depression and anxiety, yet lawyers reportedly buried these findings.\n*   **Evidence Destruction:** Whistleblowers Jason Sattizahn and Kayce Savage testified that legal counsel ordered the destruction of evidence concerning child exploitation and pedophile rings within Meta’s VR ecosystem. \n*   **Institutional Manipulation:** Lawyers reportedly sanitized research language, avoiding terms like \"illegal,\" and maintained a \"17-strike policy\" for sex trafficking accounts before removal.\n\nA critical turning point occurred in October 2025, when Judge Yvonne Williams invoked the \"crime-fraud exception\" to pierce Meta’s attorney-client privilege. She found probable cause that lawyers coached researchers to hide data on teen mental health harms to shield the company from liability.\n\nMock calls for aggressive accountability to prevent the \"transformation of law into a service available only to those wealthy enough to corrupt it.\" He urges state bar associations to investigate senior leaders like Jennifer Newstead and Joel Kaplan for potential disbarment and suggests that junior lawyers complicit in these cover-ups should be deemed unhireable. Finally, he advocates for legislative reform to prevent corporations from using attorney-client privilege as a shield for systemic wrongdoing. He concludes that the integrity of the legal system depends on ensuring that lawyers cannot facilitate harm with impunity.",

    "title": "De-dollarization: Is the US dollar losing its dominance?",
    "url": "https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/currencies/de-dollarization",
    "summary": "The article explores the accelerating global trend of **de-dollarization**, arguing that the US dollar’s long-standing hegemony is facing an unprecedented challenge. This shift is driven by a combination of geopolitical strategy, economic necessity, and a desire for financial sovereignty among emerging economies.\n\nKey points include:\n\n*   **The Weaponization of the Dollar:** The US use of financial sanctions—most notably against Russia—has alarmed many nations. By freezing foreign reserves and disconnecting countries from the SWIFT system, the US has signaled that the dollar is a political tool, prompting others to seek alternatives to mitigate \"sanction risk.\"\n*   **The Rise of BRICS:** The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are leading the transition toward a multipolar financial system. These countries are increasingly conducting bilateral trade in local currencies and discussing the development of a new, commodity-backed reserve currency to bypass the greenback.\n*   **Erosion of the Petrodollar:** A cornerstone of dollar dominance has been the requirement that global oil transactions be settled in USD. This is weakening as major exporters like Saudi Arabia explore accepting other currencies, such as the Chinese Yuan, for energy sales.\n*   **US Economic Instability:** Rising US national debt and persistent inflation are eroding global confidence in the dollar’s long-term value. Consequently, central banks are diversifying their portfolios by reducing holdings of US Treasuries and significantly increasing gold reserves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile the dollar remains the dominant medium of exchange for now, the article suggests its decline is inevitable. The world is transitioning toward a diversified financial landscape where no single currency holds absolute power, reflecting a broader shift in the global balance of economic influence.",
    "chinese_title": "去美元化：美元正在失去其主导地位吗？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了全球日益加速的“去美元化”趋势，认为美元长期的霸权地位正面临前所未有的挑战。这一转变是由地缘政治策略、经济必然性以及新兴经济体对金融主权的渴望共同推动的。\n\n核心观点包括：\n\n*   **美元的武器化：** 美国利用金融制裁（尤其是针对俄罗斯的制裁）引发了多国的警觉。通过冻结外汇储备并切断部分国家与 SWIFT 系统的联系，美国表明美元已成为一种政治工具，促使其他国家寻求替代方案以降低“制裁风险”。\n*   **金砖国家的崛起：** 金砖国家（巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非）正引领全球向多极化金融体系转型。这些国家越来越多地使用本币进行双边贸易，并讨论开发一种以大宗商品为支撑的新型储备货币，以绕过美元。\n*   **石油美元的瓦解：** 美元霸权的一大基石是全球石油交易必须以美元结算。随着沙特阿拉伯等主要出口国开始探索在能源销售中接受人民币等其他货币，这一地位正在动摇。\n*   **美国经济的不稳定性：** 美国国债的攀升和持续的通货膨胀正在削弱全球对美元长期价值的信心。因此，各国央行正通过减持美债并大幅增加黄金储备来优化其多元化投资组合。\n\n**结论：**\n尽管美元目前仍是主要的交易媒介，但本文认为其衰落不可避免。世界正向多元化的金融格局过渡，没有任何单一货币能拥有绝对权力，这反映了全球经济影响力格局的深刻转变。"

    "url": "https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/",
    "summary": "**The Unix Pipe Card Game** is an educational tool designed to teach children (and beginners) how to combine Unix commands using pipes to manipulate data. Created by author \"jackdoe,\" the game focuses on mastering fundamental commands such as `cat`, `grep`, `tail`, `head`, `wc`, `sort`, and `uniq`.\n\n**Gameplay and Rules**\nThe game is played by choosing a task from a provided list and determining if the winner will be the player who constructs the shortest or the longest valid pipe chain. Players take turns drawing cards from a deck to assemble a command sequence that solves the objective. Example tasks include:\n*   Printing specific lines (e.g., the 7th line or the second-to-last line).\n*   Finding the most or least common lines in a file.\n*   Counting lines that contain specific strings or characters.\n*   Creating a command chain that produces no output.\n\n**Educational Approach**\nThe game encourages parents to demonstrate the commands on a live terminal or a browser-based emulator like jslinux. For advanced players, an expansion pack is available that introduces process substitution and additional tools like `paste`, `tr`, `cut`, and `bc`.\n\n**Availability and Related Projects**\nLicensed under CC BY 4.0, the game is available for purchase or as a \"print-it-yourself\" PDF. The author has also developed a suite of other technical games for kids covering topics such as Python programming, C pointers, machine code (4917), RISC-V assembly (PROJEKT: OVERFLOW), and run-length encoding.",

    "summary": "In \"IP Addresses Through 2025,\" Geoff Huston reviews the state of internet addressing from the perspective of January 2026. Despite 1990s predictions that IPv4’s 4-billion-address limit would necessitate a rapid shift to IPv6, IPv4 remains dominant. This persistence is primarily due to the transition from peer-to-peer to client-server architectures and the widespread use of Network Address Translation (NAT), which allows over 30 billion devices to share roughly 3 billion public IPv4 addresses.\n\nHuston warns that NAT is not a permanent solution. Over-reliance on it may eventually fragment the internet into disconnected \"service cones\" based on content distribution boundaries. While IPv6 was designed to provide a cohesive, universal address space, its deployment remains slow, lacking a common sense of urgency among operators.\n\nKey data from 2025 includes:\n*   **Contraction:** The total allocated IPv4 pool shrunk by approximately 237,000 addresses (0.01%), ending the year at 3.687 billion.\n*   **Depletion:** The IANA pool has been exhausted for years. Most Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are now managing residual \"Available\" and \"Reserved\" pools, with the largest remaining quantities held by APNIC and AFRINIC.\n*   **Class E Space:** Roughly 268 million addresses remain reserved for \"Future Use.\" However, efforts to release this space for general use have stalled due to implementation hurdles and the consensus that resources are better spent on IPv6 transition.\n\nUltimately, the article suggests that the internet is at a crossroads. It will either achieve a cohesive whole through increased IPv6 adoption or face a future of protocol fragmentation as IPv4 reaches its absolute limits.",
