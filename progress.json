    "url": "https://crookedtimber.org/2025/06/05/occasional-paper-the-impossible-predicament-of-the-death-newts/",
    "summary": "Doug Muir's \"The Impossible Predicament of the Death Newts\" explores the intense evolutionary arms race between the Rough-Skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa) and the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) in the Pacific Northwest. This newt is incredibly toxic due to the presence of tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by symbiotic bacteria on its skin.\n\nGarter snakes in this region have evolved resistance to tetrodotoxin, prompting the newts to evolve even greater toxicity in response. This creates a feedback loop of escalating toxicity and resistance. However, both toxicity and resistance come at a cost. Toxicity requires more energy for the newt to sustain the bacteria, and resistance potentially has subtle neurological drawbacks for the snakes.\n\nInterestingly, garter snakes sequester the tetrodotoxin in their livers, making themselves toxic to their predators, incentivizing them to eat the newts despite the unpleasantness.\n\nThe newt is in a lose-lose situation. It must maintain high toxicity levels, develop defenses against its own poison, and cannot evolve warning coloration because it would only make it a target for the snakes. Nor can it become less toxic, as the snakes need them to be toxic.\n\nThe article also touches on unanswered questions, such as why newts in Alaska (where garter snakes are scarce) still exhibit some toxicity, and why the newts and snakes on Vancouver Island seem to coexist without such a fierce arms race. The author suggests the Pacific Northwest's relatively young ecosystem status contributes to the ongoing evolution of this relationship. The article concludes that while much has been learned, mysteries still remain regarding this complex interaction.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "道格·缪尔的《死亡蝾螈的绝境》探讨了太平洋西北地区粗皮蝾螈（Taricha granulosa）和普通束带蛇（Thamnophis sirtalis）之间激烈的进化军备竞赛。这种蝾螈因其皮肤上共生细菌产生的剧毒神经毒素河豚毒素而具有极强的毒性。\n\n该地区的束带蛇已经进化出对河豚毒素的抵抗力，促使蝾螈进化出更强的毒性作为回应。这形成了一个毒性和抵抗力不断升级的反馈回路。然而，毒性和抵抗力都有代价。毒性需要蝾螈消耗更多的能量来维持细菌，而抵抗力可能会给蛇带来微妙的神经系统缺陷。\n\n有趣的是，束带蛇会将河豚毒素储存在肝脏中，使其自身对捕食者有毒，从而激励它们不顾不适去吃蝾螈。\n\n蝾螈处于一个双输的局面。它必须保持高毒性水平，发展出针对自身毒药的防御机制，并且无法进化出警戒色，因为这只会使其成为蛇的目标。它也不能降低毒性，因为蛇需要它们是有毒的。\n\n文章还探讨了一些未解之谜，例如为什么阿拉斯加（束带蛇稀少）的蝾螈仍然表现出一定的毒性，以及为什么温哥华岛上的蝾螈和蛇似乎能够在没有如此激烈的军备竞赛的情况下共存。作者认为，太平洋西北地区相对年轻的生态系统状态促成了这种关系的持续演变。文章的结论是，虽然已经了解了很多，但关于这种复杂的互动仍然存在谜团。"

    "summary": "This article from Purism criticizes Google's recent restrictions on Android sideloading, arguing it undermines user autonomy and digital freedom. Google, citing security concerns and in partnership with Singapore's Cyber Security Agency, is blocking sideloading of certain apps with sensitive permissions through web browsers, messaging apps, or file managers. Furthermore, the Play Integrity API allows developers to limit functionality for sideloaded apps, pushing users to the Google Play Store.\n\nPurism argues that while these measures aim to reduce fraud and malware, they strengthen Google's monopolistic control over the Android ecosystem, limiting user freedom, innovation, and competition. Sideloading, a key aspect of Android's openness, is being marginalized, mirroring Apple's walled-garden approach.\n\nAs an alternative, Purism highlights its PureOS-powered Librem 5 and Liberty Phones, offering full user autonomy, privacy, and data sovereignty. PureOS supports secure, free and open-source applications, avoiding exploitative data mining and reliance on corporate app stores. Purism positions itself as a privacy-respecting alternative in the face of Google's tightening grip on Android.\n",

    "title": "Understanding the PURL Specification (Package URL)",
    "url": "https://fossa.com/blog/understanding-purl-specification-package-url/",
    "summary": "This article explains the Package URL (PURL) specification, an open standard for uniquely identifying software packages across different ecosystems. Created in 2017, PURLs are specially formatted URLs that encode a package's type (e.g., npm, Maven), name, version, and other qualifiers, providing a universal and machine-readable identifier.\n\nThe article details the structure of a PURL, highlighting required fields like scheme, type, and name, and optional fields like namespace, version, qualifiers, and subpath. It emphasizes PURL's broad ecosystem coverage, including npm, PyPI, Maven, Docker, and more, with specific examples.\n\nA key use case for PURL is in Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), where it acts as a unique identifier for each component. While not explicitly required by the NTIA, PURL usage is highly recommended for SBOM accuracy, enabling enrichment with licensing and vulnerability data. Both CycloneDX and SPDX SBOM formats support PURL.\n\nThe article also compares PURL to CPE (Common Platform Enumeration), another software identifier. While both aim to uniquely identify software, CPE is designed for IT products and platforms, while PURL is package-focused and better suited for the open-source world. The article concludes that PURL is generally better at handling the long tail of open-source library dependencies, making it ideal for vulnerability management and SBOM initiatives. While PURL lacks commercial product support, it is a better choice for most organizations.\n",

    "summary": "Jen Kinney's article \"Seven Days at the Bin Store\" explores the phenomenon of \"bin stores\" through the lens of a new business, Amazing Binz, in West Philadelphia. These stores acquire overstock and returned merchandise from major corporations like Walmart, Amazon, and Target, selling it at dramatically reduced prices that decrease throughout the week.\n\nThe author spends a week observing the store, starting with restock day and continuing through a full pricing cycle. The grand opening draws a large crowd, particularly resellers and those seeking bargain deals. The article highlights the motivations behind the bin store craze, fueled by the explosion of online returns, supply chain issues during the pandemic, and retailer overstocking. The reverse logistics industry is booming as corporations attempt to recoup losses from unsold or returned goods.\n\nKinney also explores the reactions of the surrounding community. While some are excited by the affordable prices and potential for reselling, others view the store as a symbol of late-stage capitalism and consumer excess, raising concerns about gentrification and the environmental impact of discarded goods. Despite varied opinions, the author notes that the store attracts a diverse clientele and provides some with the opportunity to work as resellers. The owner, Ahmed, sees the store as a way to provide value to the neighborhood and support his community.\n",

    "summary": "This research investigates the role of cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, in regulating metabolism and thermogenesis. The study found that caloric restriction (CR) in humans reduces cysteine levels in white adipose tissue. Depleting cysteine in mice leads to rapid, lethal weight loss, increased fat utilization, and browning of white adipocytes, a process that enhances heat production. Restoring cysteine in the diet reverses these effects.\n\nMechanistically, cysteine deprivation-induced adipose browning and weight loss depend on sympathetic nervous system signaling via β3-adrenergic receptors, independent of FGF21 and UCP1. In obese mice, cysteine deprivation caused quick adipose browning, increased energy expenditure, significant weight loss (around 30%), and reduced metabolic inflammation.\n\nKey findings include:\n\n*   CR in humans lowers cysteine levels in adipose tissue.\n*   Cysteine depletion in mice causes significant weight loss via adipose browning.\n*   This process requires sympathetic nervous system signaling.\n*   Cysteine deprivation reverses metabolic inflammation in obese mice.\n\nThese results suggest that cysteine is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance, and its removal triggers adipose browning and rapid weight loss, highlighting its potential role in managing metabolic disorders.\n",

    "summary": "The author discusses their experience rebuilding their eBook generator, Little Webby Press (LWP), focusing on a \"no-build\" approach to web development. The original LWP used Svelte 3, BrowserFS, Handlebars, and a typical build process. The author, disliking the complexity and reliance on transpilation in modern web development, decided to rewrite LWP to eliminate the build step.\n\nThe new LWP utilizes Mithril for the UI, replaces BrowserFS with a simple object-based file handling system, and uses Pico CSS for styling. It leverages JsDelivr for NodeJS dependencies via import maps, allowing the direct execution of written JavaScript in the browser. The entire application resides within the repository, with Github Pages serving it directly, eliminating the need for build actions or scripts.\n\nThe core functionality remains the same: users drag and drop a folder of Markdown files, and LWP generates an EPUB3 eBook and a static website. Configuration is handled through a TOML control file, and custom templates can be provided within the source folder.\n\nA significant, unexpected benefit of the rewrite was a substantial performance increase. Generating the Moby Dick eBook went from 2.5 seconds to 125 milliseconds, and generating both the eBook and website went from 4.7 seconds to under half a second.

Hallur Antoniussen, a fish harvester from the Faroe Islands, photographed the unusual iceberg while shrimp fishing near the Hopedale channel, noting its diamond-like shape and unique dark coloration.\n\nMemorial University professor Lev Tarasov believes the iceberg's age could be anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 years old. He suggests the dark color is likely due to millennia of accumulated dirt and sediment picked up by the ice as it traveled through Greenland's ice streams. The grinding of ice against the earth's crust pulverizes rock and sediment, which then spreads through the ice.\n\nTarasov theorizes that the iceberg likely broke off from a larger ice mass and rolled over, exposing its underbelly, which is rich in accumulated sediment. He also speculates that the dark color could potentially be attributed to dust from a meteorite strike that occurred in northwest Greenland around 12,000 years ago.\n\nRegardless of the precise cause, Tarasov emphasizes the dynamic nature of ice and the possibility that the iceberg contains ice that has been buried for hundreds of thousands of years. The sighting highlights the vastness and age of Greenland's ice sheet and the long journey icebergs take to reach the Labrador coast.\n",

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117",
    "summary": "This paper, \"From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning,\" investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans differ in their internal representations of knowledge, specifically focusing on the trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity. The authors, Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, introduce an information-theoretic framework based on Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to quantitatively compare how LLMs and humans categorize concepts.\n\nThe research analyzes token embeddings from various LLMs against established human categorization benchmarks. The findings reveal that while LLMs can form broad conceptual categories aligning with human judgment, they struggle with the nuanced semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. Critically, LLMs exhibit a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, sacrificing representational richness. In contrast, human conceptual systems prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual relevance, even at the cost of compressional efficiency.\n\nThe study highlights a fundamental divergence between AI and human cognitive architectures. This difference suggests that future research should focus on developing LLMs that prioritize human-aligned conceptual representations by encouraging adaptive nuance and contextual richness, rather than solely pursuing maximum compression. This could lead to LLMs with a more human-like understanding and reasoning ability.\n",

    "summary": "The article \"The Rise of 'Vibe Hacking' Is the Next AI Nightmare\" explores the growing threat of AI-assisted hacking, where individuals with limited technical skills can leverage AI to create malicious code. This \"vibe hacking\" phenomenon, fueled by readily available AI models like ChatGPT, lowers the barrier to entry for cybercrime. While unsophisticated actors pose a risk, the article emphasizes that experienced hackers using AI to amplify their capabilities are the more significant concern.\n\nExperts warn that AI can drastically scale up cybercriminal operations, enabling faster creation of malicious code and potentially leading to coordinated attacks exploiting multiple vulnerabilities simultaneously. Specifically, a skilled hacker could design a system that dynamically rewrites its malicious payload as it learns, making it incredibly difficult to defend against.\n\nAlthough AI isn't yet capable of fully replacing human offensive security experts, it's become a powerful tool in the hands of capable operators. The article highlights the emergence of tools like XBOW, an AI system developed by skilled professionals that autonomously finds and exploits vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the best defense against AI-powered attacks is AI-powered defense. The cybersecurity landscape is evolving into an arms race where those who effectively utilize AI will have the upper hand.\n",

    "summary": "OpenAI is contesting a court order demanding it preserve all ChatGPT user logs, including deleted chats, due to a copyright lawsuit filed by news organizations like The New York Times. These organizations allege OpenAI destroyed evidence by only providing chat log samples from users who consented to data retention, suspecting that ChatGPT users circumventing paywalls might delete their searches to hide their tracks.\n\nOpenAI argues the order is premature, infringes on user privacy, and forces them to violate their privacy policies and contractual obligations. They claim the order, affecting ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and API users, was based on speculation without evidence that they intentionally deleted data or that copyright infringers are more likely to delete chats.\n\nOpenAI highlights potential damage to user trust, contract breaches, and violation of global privacy regulations, along with significant engineering costs to comply. They cite user panic on social media platforms like LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter), where users expressed concerns about privacy breaches and potential security risks, with some recommending alternative AI tools.\n\nThe judge, Ona Wang, previously expressed concern that users circumventing paywalls might delete their chat logs, making the order necessary. OpenAI maintains that the news organizations have not provided sufficient justification for the sweeping data preservation order, which they believe disproportionately harms users and imposes undue burdens on the company.\n",

    "summary": "After 25 years of service, the Landsat 7 satellite has been officially decommissioned, marking the end of a significant era in Earth observation. Launched in 1999 as a joint USGS and NASA mission, Landsat 7 significantly enhanced Earth observations and provided a key part of the Landsat program’s five decade-plus record of imaging the planet’s surface. Its imagery will remain archived at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science Center.\n\nLandsat 7's Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor provided high-resolution imagery used in various applications, from monitoring drought and guiding disaster recovery to supporting farmers, land managers, and scientists in understanding and managing natural resources. It captured critical events like the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and contributed to projects such as the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica and the \"Earth As Art\" collection.\n\nAfter its official mission ended in 2024, the USGS decommissioned Landsat 7 following responsible space practices, lowering its orbit and depleting its energy sources to minimize the risk of collisions and debris creation. The satellite will now drift in orbit for approximately 55 years before re-entering Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWhile Landsat 7's work is done, the Landsat program continues with Landsat 8 and Landsat 9, and Landsat Next is planned for launch in the early 2030s, promising even greater coverage and detail.\n",

    "summary": "Seve created a 3D SVG renderer in Typescript that projects textures onto 3D objects without rasterization. The goal was to create lightweight SVGs with approximately correct perspective transformations, useful for visualizing things like circuit board designs.\n\nThe challenge is that SVGs primarily support affine transformations, not perspective transforms. To overcome this, the renderer subdivides the texture image and applies a locally-correct affine transformation to each subdivision, using clip paths to trim the edges.\n\nThe author experimented with different levels of subdivision. While coarser subdivisions resulted in a rough, faceted appearance, increasing the subdivision count significantly smoothed the texture projection. By around 512 subdivisions, the effect became visually indistinguishable from a true perspective projection.\n\nA key benefit is the relatively small SVG file size, achieved by using SVG's `defs` element to avoid repeating the texture image data. Only the clip paths need to be defined for each subdivision.\n\nThe author included a table illustrating the SVG file size at different subdivision levels, noting that the scaling isn't perfectly linear. The renderer is intended to be used with circuit board designs within React, providing a visual representation of changes in pull requests on platforms like GitHub.\n",

He argues that Apple Notes is well-suited to its current WYSIWYG rich text editing interface, especially on mobile devices. He emphasizes that Markdown's primary use case is for web writing and situations where plain text files are necessary, and that forcing Apple Notes into a Markdown editor role would be a mistake, potentially leading to malformed notes.\n\nGruber praises Apple Notes' simplified formatting options, where users choose from predefined styles instead of individual fonts, aligning with a user-friendly Macintosh experience. He contrasts this with Markdown editors that often require preview modes and syntax awareness. He does, however, criticize Apple Notes' implementation of hashtags for tagging, arguing that they should have adopted a more sophisticated, tokenized system similar to the Finder, allowing for spaces and avoiding the need for the \"#\" prefix.\n\nWhile opposed to a full Markdown editor, Gruber is enthusiastic about the prospect of Markdown export from Apple Notes, seeing it as a significant improvement over the current crude export options of PDF and Pages.

Since 2017, iPhones have captured depth maps using various technologies, storing them alongside other imagery in HEIC files.\n\nThe article demonstrates how to install the necessary prerequisites, including Python, `exiftool`, `jc`, and OpenImageIO, on an Ubuntu environment within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It then walks through extracting the gain map, base image, HDR gain map, and depth map from an HEIC image provided by Joel Joseph.\n\nThe core of the article focuses on converting the HEIC image into an OpenEXR file, a high-dynamic range image format used in visual effects. It details the `heic_to_exr.py` script, which utilizes `oiiotool` to perform various image processing steps. These steps include color space conversions (from sRGB to Linear P3 to ACEScg), resizing, channel manipulation, and scaling the gain map using the HDR headroom value. Finally, the script combines the processed base image, gain map, and depth map into a single EXR file with distinct channels for each component (RGB, SDR, gainmap, and depth).\n\nThe resulting EXR file preserves the original image data and depth information, enabling advanced image manipulation and analysis.

    "url": "https://mattrighetti.com/2025/05/03/authentication-with-axum",
    "summary": "This article discusses authentication in Axum, a Rust web framework, focusing on a common scenario: a navbar that displays \"Profile\" or \"Login\" based on user authentication status. It advocates for using cookies for authentication due to their reliability, browser management, and security features like HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes.\n\nThe author demonstrates implementing a login endpoint that sets JWT and refresh token cookies upon successful authentication. JWTs are short-lived and contain user information, while refresh tokens are longer-lived and used to request new JWTs.\n\nThe article then explores using Axum extractors to derive user context from cookies. A custom `CookieJwt` extractor attempts to extract user data from the JWT cookie in the request. If found, the user is considered authenticated. If a refresh token is present but the JWT is not, the user is redirected to a `/refresh_token` endpoint to obtain a new JWT.\n\nFinally, the article introduces authentication middleware as a cleaner and more flexible approach. An example `base` middleware function validates JWT and refresh tokens, sets a `UserContext`, and manages cookie updates. This middleware can be applied at different levels, offering greater control over authentication logic.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the \"Efficient Chain-Linking Algorithm,\" developed at Inria in the late 1980s when memory was extremely limited. The algorithm, preserved by Software Heritage, exemplifies efficient computer vision techniques under constraint. The PASTIS team at Inria, led by Gérard Giraudon, Philippe Garnesson, and Patrick Cipière, aimed to improve real-time performance in computer vision for robots.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently processes 2D pixel matrices from contour detection, outputting a list of contour chains representing object boundaries. Its cleverness lies in processing images line-by-line, storing only three lines in memory at a time, and dynamically allocating memory for chain lists. This allowed it to build and extend chains of connected pixels on the fly, and then merge them. This approach was critical due to the limited RAM available in computers at the time.\n\nThe preservation of this code is part of a larger effort to archive Inria's legacy software, involving outreach, workshops, and secure archiving within Software Heritage. While modern computer vision leverages deep learning and abundant memory, often processing entire images at once, this algorithm's memory efficiency remains valuable, presenting a lean alternative to memory-intensive methods. The article concludes with links to the preserved source code and related research papers.\n",

    "summary": "This Let's Encrypt blog post discusses their approach to mitigating the impact of \"zombie clients\" – abandoned or misconfigured servers that continuously and unsuccessfully request certificate renewals, wasting resources.  These clients repeatedly fail because, for example, the domain name they're requesting a certificate for no longer points to them.\n\nTo address this, Let's Encrypt implemented a \"pausing\" mechanism that temporarily limits certificate requests for specific account-hostname pairs that consistently fail validation. This \"Consecutive Authorization Failures per Hostname Per Account\" rate limit pauses only the failing hostname on the account, allowing other certificates to be issued normally.  The rate limit is designed to be non-punitive, targeting only the most persistent failures, and a single successful validation resets the limit.\n\nCrucially, Let's Encrypt provides a self-service \"unpause\" link in the error message when a request is blocked.  This allows subscribers who are aware of the issue and want to resolve it to immediately resume certificate issuance. However, only 3% of paused accounts have used this unpause feature, confirming that the majority are indeed abandoned. The unpause feature also allows for mass unpausing (up to 50,000 domains) which may be necessary in the case of widespread misconfigurations, such as a recent software bug.\n\nSince implementation, over 100,000 account-hostname pairs have been paused, resulting in a 30% reduction in failed certificate orders, with no complaints from users. Let's Encrypt encourages client developers to randomize renewal request times and implement a back-off strategy for repeated failures to further reduce the impact of zombie clients.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores Amelia Earhart's ill-fated final flights and questions the narrative of her as a fully skilled and prepared aviator. It highlights her initial round-the-world attempt, which ended in a crash in Honolulu due to pilot error, and reveals that she relied on experienced pilots like Paul Mantz for assistance.\n\nThe article points out that Earhart's fame stemmed from being the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane, despite being only a passenger. It suggests she leveraged this notoriety to push her piloting career, sometimes at the expense of thorough preparation and training. Putnam, her husband and manager, is portrayed as aggressively managing her image and career, prioritizing publicity and book deals over safety and genuine skill development.\n\nThe second attempt, with navigator Fred Noonan, is scrutinized due to Noonan's known drinking problem and both Earhart and Noonan's casual approach to radio communication (specifically, Morse code). Experts like Bradford Washburn and Jacqueline Cochran cautioned against the dangerous Howland Island leg, citing inadequate navigational equipment and preparation. The article also references accounts from fellow female pilots like Elinor Smith, who questioned Earhart's flying skills and Putnam's opportunistic tactics. Ultimately, the article suggests that Earhart's final flights were driven more by a need to maintain her celebrity status and fulfill contractual obligations than by genuine readiness for such a challenging endeavor.\n",

The author contends that AGI requires a fundamental understanding of the physical world, including sensorimotor reasoning, motion planning, and social coordination, which current AI models lack.\n\nThe author criticizes the \"predict-next-token\" objective of Large Language Models (LLMs), arguing that they learn superficial heuristics and syntax rather than genuine semantic understanding. LLMs can mimic language proficiency without grasping the underlying real-world concepts. This is fundamentally different from human intelligence, where language is intertwined with experience and interaction with the environment.\n\nThe author also challenges the notion that simply scaling up existing models and modalities will lead to AGI. This approach, the author argues, is inefficient and makes implicit assumptions about the structure of individual modalities and how they should be combined. Quoting Rich Sutton's \"Bitter Lesson\", the author says we should learn to find and capture arbitrary complexity rather than assuming it.\n\nThe author proposes that instead of trying to patch together modalities, research should focus on embodied intelligence and interaction with the environment. Only by prioritizing embodiment and environment will we see modality-centered processing as an emergent phenomenon and start to truly approach AGI.\n",

    "summary": "This arXiv paper, \"Not All Tokens Are Meant to Be Forgotten,\" addresses the challenge of \"unlearning\" unwanted information in Large Language Models (LLMs) without significantly impacting their overall utility. Current unlearning methods often over-forget by indiscriminately suppressing all tokens within forget samples, leading to performance degradation.\n\nThe authors propose a novel framework called Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) to tackle this problem. TIF consists of two key components: (1) a targeted information identifier that distinguishes between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) within forget samples; and (2) a Targeted Preference Optimization approach. This optimization uses Logit Preference Loss to unlearn information associated with UW while using Preservation Loss to retain information associated with GW. This allows the model to forget specific unwanted information while preserving general knowledge and language abilities.\n\nThe paper claims that TIF improves unlearning effectiveness and preserves model utility, achieving state-of-the-art results on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks.

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18600",
    "summary": "This article presents Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a novel framework for extreme single-image super-resolution (SISR). Current SISR models struggle to scale beyond their training scale factors. CoZ overcomes this limitation by factorizing the SISR task into an autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states, re-using a backbone SR model repeatedly. This decomposes the problem into smaller, more manageable steps, allowing for extreme resolutions without requiring additional training of the SR model itself.\n\nTo combat the diminishing visual cues at high magnifications, CoZ incorporates multi-scale-aware text prompts generated by a vision-language model (VLM) at each zoom step. These prompts guide the SR process. Crucially, the prompt extractor is fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic VLM, aligning the text guidance towards human preference. This preference alignment ensures the generated high-resolution images are perceptually pleasing.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that CoZ, when applied to a standard 4x diffusion SR model, can achieve beyond 256x enlargement with high perceptual quality and fidelity. The project page for CoZ is available at the provided URL. The paper is categorized under Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Machine Learning (cs.LG).\n",

Miller recounts his initial fear of low-level languages, contrasting them with his comfort in high-level web languages. He argues that machine code is not as intimidating as it seems and can be understood with a basic grasp of its components.\n\nThe article covers two prominent instruction sets: ARM64 (AArch64) and x86-64. For AArch64, Miller explains that instructions are 32-bit numbers encoding operations, arguments (registers or memory addresses), and constants (immediates). He uses the \"add immediate\" instruction as an example, dissecting its bit representation and how it's used to add values to registers.\n\nRegisters are presented as small storage locations, while memory is likened to an array. The \"STR\" (store) instruction is used to illustrate how data is written to memory locations based on register values and offsets.\n\nThe article then briefly touches upon x86-64 architecture, highlighting its variable-width instruction set and introducing key components like REX, ModR/M, and OpCode. A \"move immediate\" instruction example demonstrates how these parts are assembled.\n\nMiller acknowledges the existence of other complexities like flags, calling conventions, and the stack, but emphasizes that understanding the basics is the crucial first step. He encourages readers to explore compiler explorer and experiment with low-level code to overcome mental blocks and gain a deeper understanding of how software truly works.\n",

Caulfield's research highlights that not all LLMs are created equal when it comes to these crucial areas, impacting their reliability for research and information retrieval tasks.\n\nThe core of the article focuses on experiments comparing different LLMs on their performance in two key areas:\n\n*   **Link Hallucination:** The propensity to invent nonexistent URLs when asked to provide sources or citations. The article suggests that the severity of link hallucination differs significantly among LLMs. Some models are significantly more likely to generate fabricated links than others.\n\n*   **Source Comprehension:** The ability to accurately understand and synthesize information from provided source material. This includes identifying key facts, understanding the author's intent, and avoiding misinterpretations. Again, the article points to variations in performance across different LLMs, with some exhibiting a better capacity to accurately process and summarize complex information.\n\nCaulfield emphasizes that users should be aware of these differences when choosing an LLM for tasks requiring factual accuracy and reliable source attribution. Relying on an LLM prone to hallucination or with poor source comprehension can lead to misinformation and flawed conclusions. The article implicitly calls for more robust evaluation methods and transparency from LLM developers regarding these limitations.

    "summary": "The author expresses their exhaustion with the GenAI discourse and outlines their skepticism, despite acknowledging the difficulty in definitively proving its flaws. They describe their thinking process as \"Monkesque,\" characterized by obsessive attention to detail and incongruities, which they usually use to solve problems but find stymied by GenAI.\n\nThe author criticizes \"anti-anti-GenAI\" articles for straw-manning skeptical arguments and ignoring significant issues like climate impact and disinformation. While their own experiences with GenAI have been largely negative, they admit this is anecdotal and scientific data is lacking, making it hard to refute claims of neutral-to-positive experiences.\n\nA key concern is the aesthetic unpleasantness of interacting with GenAI systems, especially in software development. The author finds the outputs often unusable, full of errors, and leading to decreased productivity. They are particularly distressed by the possibility that GenAI might \"work\" just well enough to fool executives despite its inefficiencies, leading to its mandated use.\n\nThe author dislikes the experience of coding with \"agentic\" LLMs, finding it a frustrating parody of code review where a robot consistently makes mistakes and requires constant correction without genuine learning or improvement.\n\nFinally, the author argues that LLMs primarily afford the faster production of text, which could discourage addressing underlying issues like boilerplate code or defects in information architecture, hindering progress and innovation. The author ultimately seeks to disengage from the GenAI debate, feeling unable to resolve the contradictions and burdened by its negative impact on their well-being.\n",

The story of Washington's weirdest traffic circle\" explores the unusual location of a Wendy's restaurant in the middle of the Columbia Heights traffic circle in Washington D.C. The article details the history of the circle, designed in the late 19th century to allow streetcars to turn around. Over time, as streetcars declined, the circle became a more traditional traffic roundabout.\n\nHowever, the central island remained undeveloped until the 1980s when developers eyed the space. The resulting Wendy's restaurant, opened in 1985, became a local oddity and landmark. The article highlights the bureaucratic hurdles and negotiations that allowed the fast-food chain to establish itself in such an unconventional location. It discusses the restaurant's unique design, forced by its triangular footprint, and its enduring popularity despite its challenging accessibility.\n\nThe article also delves into the local community's mixed feelings about the Wendy's, acknowledging its convenience and nostalgic value for some while recognizing its visual incongruity and contribution to traffic congestion. The piece portrays the Wendy's as a symbol of D.C.'s quirky urban landscape, a testament to the city's unique blend of planned infrastructure and unexpected development.

While Unified Diffs are ubiquitous, they lack standardization in areas like encodings, revisions, metadata, and filename representation, hindering reliable parsing by tools. This limits the ability of tools to extract and utilize useful information from diffs, particularly when dealing with multiple source control systems, binary files, and commit lists.\n\nDiffX aims to solve these problems by providing a structured and metadata-rich format that is fully backwards-compatible with existing tools and human-readable. It leverages the forgiving nature of Unified Diffs, where unrecognized data is generally skipped, and introduces standardized rules for parsing, formalized metadata storage for diffs, commits, and files, and the ability to extend the format without breaking existing parsers. DiffX also supports binary diffs, text encoding awareness, and multiple commits in a single file.\n\nThe design prioritizes compatibility, mutability, and avoids vendor lock-in. It does not force adoption of a completely new file format or break existing diffs. The article links to more detailed information about the problems with diffs, the DiffX file format specification, examples, and a FAQ. Python implementation 'pydiffx' is available, and Review Board from Beanbag is adopting DiffX to address long-standing diff-related issues.\n",

The lack of a global progress bar during distribution set extraction is also noted. The networking configuration section is criticized for ambiguous prompts and redundant confirmation screens.\nThe author suggests specific improvements, like adding more detailed explanations, offering options to modify partition layouts, clarifying network media type options, and handling FQDN hostnames.\n\nOverall, the article praises NetBSD's willingness to accept contributions and its slim design but argues that sysinst could be more user-friendly for newcomers.\n",

These machines were adopted by government institutions, businesses, and celebrities, including U.S. presidents and NASA astronauts.\n\nNASA used Autopens to manage the high volume of autograph requests from the public. The most common model used was the Autopen Model 80, manufactured by the Damilic Corporation. This machine used a template, created from a real signature, that guided a mechanical arm holding a pen to reproduce the signature on various items. Apollo-era templates took the form of a Plexiglas spiral.\n\nA skilled operator could produce thousands of signatures per day. The guide highlights that Apollo-era machines used fixed patterns which allowed signature experts to distinguish them from genuine signatures. The guide aims to help people identify these Autopenned signatures, suggesting that a limited number of signature patterns were used by each astronaut.\n",

A study by Coworker.org found that startups are creating increasingly sophisticated tools to track, manage, and supervise workers, often using AI. This \"Little Tech\" ecosystem, largely unregulated, includes biometric tracking, AI-powered productivity monitoring, and predictive analytics.\n\nThe rise of algorithmic management creates stress and a \"culture of suspiciousness\" for workers, particularly in the gig economy and informal labor sectors. Many tools are first tested in Latin America, where labor laws are less stringent. Workers in countries like Kenya, Guatemala, and Brazil report feeling constantly surveilled and having reduced control over their work. For example, Uber drivers feel monitored via the app, tracking speed and braking.\n\nThe article highlights five categories of algorithmic management tools: timekeeping and attendance systems, biometric verification, performance monitoring platforms, algorithmic management/predictive analytics, and gig economy tracking. Examples include Rankmi (Chile), Cincel (Mexico), Ahgora (Brazil), Visier (used by Deloitte and Accenture), and Rappi (Colombia). While data protection laws exist in some countries, enforcement is inconsistent. Workers are often unaware of how their data is collected and utilized, leading to concerns about autonomy and fair treatment.\n",

    "summary": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" began as fragments of ideas Freddie Mercury conceived in the late 60s. The song, initially nicknamed \"The Cowboy Song,\" was meticulously crafted, with Mercury mapping out harmonies and envisioning operatic sections. Queen rehearsed extensively and recorded the song in 1975 at Rockfield Studios, layering 160 vocal tracks for the operatic section.\n\nThe lyrics are rich with references, from Scaramouche to Bismillah and Beelzebub, reflecting Mercury's complex personality. Completed after refinements in multiple studios, the song was recognized as something special, with producer Roy Thomas Baker calling it \"a big page in history.\"\n\nDespite initial reluctance from the record company due to its length, Queen insisted on releasing it as a single. With help from DJ Kenny Everett, it gained airplay and reached No. 1. The music video, directed by Bruce Gowers, further propelled its success.\n\nReleased in October 1975, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was an immediate hit. It topped the UK charts for nine weeks and became Queen's first US Top 10 hit. It has received numerous accolades and remains a staple of Queen's live performances.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" has become one of the most-streamed songs of all time and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Mercury wanted listeners to interpret the song in their own way. The song's renewed popularity can be attributed to the movie Wayne's World, which introduced it to a new audience.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses the problem of \"Flash of Incomplete Markdown\" (FOIM) when streaming AI responses, particularly from OpenAI. The author, Blake Kadatz, experienced this issue with Streak's AI feature that provides answers to questions about deals, citing relevant information from emails and other sources.  The incomplete markdown rendering, especially with lengthy URLs, led to a poor user experience.\n\nFurthermore, they encountered \"hallucinations\" where OpenAI fabricated incorrect URLs for citations by combining parts of different keys. To combat both issues, they implemented a solution involving shortened, Wikipedia-style numerical links (e.g., `[1](#REF3)`).\n\nThe core of their solution is a server-side state machine that dynamically detects the start of a markdown link, buffers the URL, replaces the short URL with the full, correct URL from a pre-existing map, and only then sends the complete, processed markdown link to the client in a single chunk.\n\nThis approach offers several advantages: reduces token consumption (leading to lower costs and faster responses), eliminates link hallucinations, prevents the flash of incomplete markdown (even for non-shortened URLs), and potentially enhances privacy by avoiding the transmission of the full URLs to OpenAI. The state machine handles TEXT, LINK_TEXT, EXIT_LINK_TEXT, and LINK_URL states. This ensures that only complete, valid markdown links are displayed to the user, resulting in a cleaner and more reliable experience.\n",

Researchers using data from the Hubble and Gaia space telescopes simulated the galaxies' evolution and found only a 2% probability of a collision within the next 5 billion years. While close encounters are possible, many simulations show the galaxies passing at a distance that leaves them largely unaffected.\n\nIf a collision does happen, the study suggests it's more likely in 7 to 8 billion years, significantly later than previous estimations. Such a merger would destroy both galaxies, creating an elliptical galaxy with a central black hole emitting intense radiation.\n\nDr. Till Sawala, who led the study, clarifies that the new findings don't invalidate earlier calculations but rather leverage new data to explore a wider range of possibilities. Further data from the Gaia telescope promises even more accurate measurements, potentially resolving remaining uncertainties.\n\nProfessor Carlos Frenk emphasizes the power of physics and supercomputers in simulating galactic evolution over billions of years to understand their ultimate destiny.

While classic psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin show promise in treating anxiety, depression, PTSD, and addiction by promoting neuron growth and synaptic connections, their hallucinogenic effects limit their widespread clinical use.\n\nThe article highlights how advances in understanding the interaction between psychedelic molecules and the brain are driving research into non-hallucinogenic alternatives. Researchers are studying the role of serotonin receptors, electron transfer properties, and lipophilicity in the effects of psychedelics. This knowledge facilitates rational drug design, aided by advances in chemical synthesis, such as the development of JRT, an LSD analogue that stimulates neural branching without inducing hallucinations in rodent models.\n\nSkeletal editing techniques are expected to further accelerate the creation of previously inaccessible analogues. However, challenges remain, including the need for human clinical trials with diverse participants to accurately assess efficacy and the importance of hallucinations in therapeutic effects. The article concludes by drawing a parallel between the historical, culturally significant use of psychoactive plants and the potential of non-hallucinogenic psychedelics to transform mental health treatment in the future.\n",

    "summary": "In June 2025, Nucleus Genomics unveiled a $5,999 service allowing prospective parents undergoing IVF to rank embryos based on predicted IQ, height, eye color, and nearly 900 health-related traits. The New York startup uses whole-genome data from partner labs to generate \"polygenic\" risk scores, providing a dashboard to parents with predictions for traits like intelligence, stature, appearance, and lifespan, along with probabilities for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\n\nCEO Kian Sadeghi defends the service, arguing parents deserve this extra information for such a personal decision. The service goes beyond traditional pre-implantation testing, applying algorithms to predict future traits based on numerous genetic variants. Nucleus relies on Genomic Prediction, which has already screened thousands of embryos, for biopsies.\n\nThe service has gained attention in longevity circles, but also raises ethical concerns. Dr. Paula Amato worries about a society selecting certain types of children over others, although she acknowledges it's the patients' prerogative. Sadeghi frames it as an extension of the longevity movement, arguing that DNA testing can help predict and reduce chronic disease. Competitor Orchid Health offers similar testing at a higher price point.\n",

    "summary": "This Space.com article explores the possibility of life surviving on Jupiter's moon Europa after the sun becomes a red giant. When the sun enters its final phase, expanding to engulf Mercury and Venus, Earth will likely be destroyed. However, as the sun's habitable zone moves outward, Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa, might experience a period of potential habitability.\n\nResearchers at the Carl Sagan Institute suggest that Europa's icy shell will sublimate due to increased heat from the expanded sun and Jupiter's reflected sunlight. While equatorial regions will experience significant water loss, higher latitudes on the side of Europa facing away from Jupiter could retain a tenuous water vapor atmosphere for up to 200 million years.\n\nThis brief window of opportunity, while short compared to Earth's history, might allow for the survival of life. The article also points out the potential for finding biosignatures on formerly icy moons around red giant stars beyond our solar system using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope or the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory. While unlikely, this scenario expands the scope of the search for extraterrestrial life to include refuges around dying stars.\n",

NASA would see planetary science gutted, including the Mars Sample Return mission, while numerous astrophysics missions would be cancelled. The NSF faces brutal cuts across all disciplines, with grant funding rates plummeting and widespread program eliminations, particularly those aimed at broadening participation in science. Key research facilities, like LIGO and telescopes, would be shut down or transferred. The Department of Energy would essentially eliminate funding for wind, solar, and renewable grid integration.\n\nThe author argues these cuts would cripple US scientific leadership and have lasting consequences, harming STEM education and driving talent overseas. While Congress previously mitigated similar proposals, there's less optimism this time.\n\nThe article criticizes the National Academies of Science (NAS) for largely ignoring the current crisis at their \"State of the Science\" event, focusing instead on pre-existing trends. NAS President Marcia McNutt's presentation is described as avoiding direct criticism of the Trump administration while suggesting regulatory rollbacks could be beneficial.

    "url": "https://blog.fredrb.com/2025/06/02/futex-fun/",
    "summary": "This article explores implementing optimized locks in Linux, contrasting simple spin locks with more sophisticated futex-based locks. It starts by showing a basic C spin lock implementation using `atomic_exchange` and highlights its inefficiency due to high CPU consumption when threads must wait.\n\nThe article then introduces futexes, a Linux syscall enabling threads to sleep while waiting for a lock, avoiding excessive spinning. It explains the core concepts of `FUTEX_WAIT` and `FUTEX_WAKE`, and demonstrates common pitfalls and behaviors through various scenarios.\n\nThe author presents a futex-based mutex implementation and compares its performance against the spin lock. Surprisingly, the naive spin lock, when enhanced with `sched_yield()`, initially outperforms the futex lock. The article attributes this to the overhead of syscalls associated with futexes.\n\nTo address this, an improved futex lock implementation based on the \"Futexes Are Tricky\" paper is introduced, focusing on avoiding unnecessary `FUTEX_WAKE` calls by tracking whether waiters exist.  While better, it's still slightly slower than the yielding spinlock.\n\nFinally, the article emphasizes that micro-benchmarks involving simple increment operations don't accurately represent mutex use cases. A more realistic example with a fibonacci calculation is used to simulate real-world contention. This reveals that the futex-based implementation is significantly faster and uses fewer CPU resources in high-contention scenarios, due to spinlocks wasting CPU time. The article concludes by suggesting a hybrid approach: spinning for a short period before resorting to futexes.\n",
    "chinese_title": "Futex乐趣",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了在Linux中实现优化锁，对比了简单的自旋锁和更复杂的基于futex的锁。文章首先展示了一个使用`atomic_exchange`实现的基本C自旋锁，并强调了当线程必须等待时，由于CPU消耗过高而导致的效率低下。\n\n接着，文章介绍了futexes，这是一种Linux系统调用，允许线程在等待锁时休眠，从而避免过度自旋。文章解释了`FUTEX_WAIT`和`FUTEX_WAKE`的核心概念，并通过各种场景展示了常见的陷阱和行为。\n\n作者提出了一个基于futex的互斥锁实现，并将其性能与自旋锁进行了比较。令人惊讶的是，当增强了`sched_yield()`时，简单的自旋锁最初的性能优于futex锁。文章将此归因于与futexes相关的系统调用开销。\n\n为了解决这个问题，文章介绍了一种基于“Futexes Are Tricky”论文的改进型futex锁实现，重点在于通过跟踪是否存在等待者来避免不必要的`FUTEX_WAKE`调用。虽然有所改善，但仍然比yielding自旋锁略慢。\n\n最后，文章强调，涉及简单递增操作的微基准测试并不能准确地代表互斥锁的使用情况。文章使用了一个更真实的例子，即斐波那契数列计算，来模拟真实世界的竞争。这表明，在高度竞争的情况下，基于futex的实现速度明显更快，并且使用的CPU资源更少，因为自旋锁浪费了CPU时间。文章最后建议采用一种混合方法：在求助于futexes之前，先自旋一小段时间。"

    "summary": "The Go Blog post \"No Syntactic Support for Error Handling\" by Robert Griesemer discusses the long-standing issue of verbose error handling in Go. The article details multiple past attempts by the Go team to address this, including the \"check and handle\" mechanism, the \"try\" proposal, and the \"?\" operator inspired by Rust. All of these proposals ultimately failed to achieve sufficient consensus within the Go community.\n\nDespite user surveys consistently highlighting error handling verbosity as a top complaint, the Go team has decided to cease pursuing syntactic solutions for the foreseeable future. The author argues that after 15 years, Go has a functional, albeit verbose, way to handle errors, and introducing a new syntax would create division within the community. Furthermore, language changes are costly and time-consuming.\n\nThe article suggests alternative approaches, such as focusing on improving error handling practices (e.g., adding stack traces) and enhancing standard library functionality. IDE tooling could also help mitigate the verbosity by allowing developers to hide error handling code during reading. The post emphasizes that while writing error checks can be tedious, robust error handling often involves adding valuable context to errors. The author concludes that the Go team will focus on studying the underlying issues of error handling in greater depth rather than pursuing syntactic changes.

    "chinese_summary": "Go博客文章《没有语法支持的错误处理》由Robert Griesemer撰写，讨论了Go语言中冗长错误处理的长期存在的问题。文章详细介绍了Go团队过去为解决这个问题所做的多次尝试，包括“check and handle”机制、“try”提案以及受Rust启发的“？”运算符。所有这些提案最终都未能获得Go社区的充分共识。\n\n尽管用户调查一直强调错误处理的冗长性是主要抱怨之一，但Go团队已决定在可预见的未来停止寻求语法解决方案。作者认为，经过15年的发展，Go已经拥有了一种功能性的、尽管冗长的错误处理方式，而引入新的语法会在社区内造成分裂。此外，语言更改既昂贵又耗时。\n\n文章建议了其他方法，例如专注于改进错误处理实践（例如，添加堆栈跟踪）和增强标准库功能。IDE工具还可以通过允许开发人员在阅读期间隐藏错误处理代码来帮助缓解冗长性。这篇文章强调，虽然编写错误检查可能很繁琐，但健壮的错误处理通常涉及向错误添加有价值的上下文。作者总结说，Go团队将专注于更深入地研究错误处理的根本问题，而不是追求语法上的改变。作者指出，最近与Go用户的一次会议，他们大多支持现状。"

    "title": "There should be no Computer Art (1971)",
    "url": "https://dam.org/museum/essays_ui/essays/there-should-be-no-computer-art/",
    "summary": "In his 1971 article \"There Should Be No Computer Art,\" Frieder Nake critiques the burgeoning field of computer art, arguing against its validity and relevance. He sees it as a fleeting fashion, driven by art dealers and market forces rather than genuine artistic advancement. Nake contends that computer art has not significantly contributed to the repertoire of aesthetic behavior and that the attention it receives is disproportionate to its artistic merit.\n\nHe criticizes the prevalent questions surrounding computer art, such as \"is a computer creative?\", deeming them irrelevant in the face of pressing societal issues. Nake suggests that the resources devoted to computer art would be better utilized in addressing real-world problems through the use of visual communication, like creating films about wealth distribution and enhanced by an aesthetically satisfying presentation.\n\nNake does acknowledge the potential of computers as tools for investigating aesthetic phenomena and improving communication. He proposes specific research areas, including studying the alienation of artists from their work due to technology, analyzing the signs and symbols used in art, testing the significance of aesthetic measures, and investigating the role of aesthetic information in various areas of life. Ultimately, Nake advocates for shifting the focus from creating \"computer art\" for galleries to utilizing computers for meaningful investigations of visual experience that address social needs.\n",
    "chinese_title": "不应有电脑艺术 (1971)",
    "chinese_summary": "在其1971年的文章《不应存在电脑艺术》中，弗里德尔·纳克批判了新兴的电脑艺术领域，反对其有效性和相关性。他认为这是一种转瞬即逝的时尚，由艺术品交易商和市场力量驱动，而非真正的艺术进步。纳克认为，电脑艺术并未对审美行为的范畴做出重大贡献，其所受到的关注与其艺术价值不成比例。\n\n他批评了围绕电脑艺术的普遍问题，例如“电脑是否有创造力？”，认为在面对紧迫的社会问题时，这些问题无关紧要。纳克建议，用于电脑艺术的资源最好用于通过视觉交流解决现实世界的问题，例如制作关于财富分配的电影，并通过令人满意的审美呈现来增强效果。\n\n纳克确实承认计算机作为研究审美现象和改善交流工具的潜力。他提出了具体的研究领域，包括研究艺术家因技术而与作品疏远的关系，分析艺术中使用的符号，测试审美衡量标准的重要性，以及调查审美信息在生活各个领域中的作用。最终，纳克提倡将重点从为画廊创作“电脑艺术”转移到利用计算机对解决社会需求的视觉体验进行有意义的调查。"
