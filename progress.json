    "url": "https://z.ai/blog/glm-5",
    "summary": "Zhipu AI recently introduced **GLM-5**, a significant evolution in their model lineup that signals a strategic shift from \"vibe coding\"—models that prioritize sounding human or \"feeling\" right—to \"agentic engineering,\" which focuses on reliability, precision, and functional task execution.\n\n**Key Highlights of GLM-5:**\n\n*   **Performance Benchmarks:** GLM-5 is positioned as a top-tier competitor to models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. It demonstrates superior performance in reasoning, mathematics, and coding, particularly within the Chinese language ecosystem and complex logic tasks.\n*   **Long-Context Processing:** The model supports an expansive context window (reaching 1M tokens and beyond), allowing it to analyze massive datasets, entire libraries of code, or lengthy documents without losing coherence or accuracy.\n*   **Native Multimodality:** Designed with native multimodal capabilities, GLM-5 can seamlessly process and generate content across text, images, and video, facilitating more natural human-computer interaction.\n*   **Agentic Capabilities:** The core of GLM-5 is its focus on \"agentic engineering.\" This emphasizes the model's ability to function as an autonomous agent, excelling at complex tool use, multi-step planning, and interacting with external software environments to complete real-world tasks.\n*   **Model Ecosystem:** Zhipu AI continues to support the developer community by offering various model sizes and versions via their BigModel.cn platform, aiming to provide the structural reliability required for enterprise-grade AI applications.\n\nUltimately, GLM-5 represents a move toward AI that can \"do\" rather than just \"talk,\" providing the precision and stability necessary for building sophisticated AI agents that can navigate complex digital workflows.",
    "chinese_title": "GLM-5：从氛围编程到智能体工程",
    "chinese_summary": "智谱 AI 最近推出了 GLM-5，这是其模型系列的重大演进，标志着从“氛围编程”（vibe coding，即优先考虑拟人化感官或“感觉”对路的模型）向“智能体工程”（agentic engineering，侧重于可靠性、精确度和功能性任务执行）的战略转型。\n\n**GLM-5 核心亮点：**\n\n*   **性能基准：** GLM-5 被定位为 OpenAI GPT-4o 等顶级模型的强力竞争者。它在推理、数学和编程方面表现卓越，尤其是在中文语言生态和复杂逻辑任务中。\n*   **长文本处理：** 该模型支持极广的上下文窗口（可达 100 万及以上 token），使其能够分析海量数据集、完整代码库或长篇文档，且不失连贯性与准确性。\n*   **原生多模态：** GLM-5 采用原生多模态设计，能够无缝处理和生成文本、图像及视频内容，促进更自然的人机交互。\n*   **智能体能力：** GLM-5 的核心在于对“智能体工程”的关注。这强调了模型作为自主智能体的能力，擅长复杂工具调用、多步规划，并能与外部软件环境交互以完成现实任务。\n*   **模型生态：** 智谱 AI 通过其 BigModel.cn 平台提供多种尺寸和版本的模型，持续支持开发者社区，旨在为企业级 AI 应用提供所需的结构化可靠性。\n\n归根结底，GLM-5 代表了 AI 从“能言善辩”向“实干高效”的转变，为构建能够处理复杂数字化工作流的高级 AI 智能体提供了所需的精准度与稳定性。"

    "summary": "The article from *SciTechDaily* highlights groundbreaking but controversial research from Carnegie Mellon University, where scientists have developed a method to track human 3D poses and movements through walls using standard WiFi routers.\n\n**The Technology**\nBy utilizing Channel State Information (CSI) from WiFi signals—the data that describes how signals travel from a transmitter to a receiver—researchers can detect how human bodies interfere with the signal. They paired this data with a deep neural network called DensePose, which maps the pixels of a person’s body to a 3D surface. This allows the system to reconstruct human postures and movements in real-time without the need for cameras or expensive sensors like LiDAR.\n\n**Key Advantages and Use Cases**\nThe researchers argue that this technology is a low-cost, accessible alternative to traditional monitoring. It functions in the dark and can see through obstacles like drywall and furniture. Potential positive applications include healthcare—specifically monitoring the safety and well-being of elderly individuals living alone—without the intrusive nature of traditional video cameras.\n\n**Privacy and Surveillance Concerns**\nDespite the potential benefits, the technology raises significant ethical alarms. Because WiFi routers are ubiquitous in homes and public spaces, this capability could effectively turn everyday infrastructure into an \"invisible mass surveillance system.\" While the researchers suggest it is more private than cameras because it doesn't capture facial features, critics warn that it allows for the monitoring of individuals in their most private spaces without their consent or knowledge.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe study demonstrates that the hardware required to \"see\" through walls is already present in most households.

Sweden and the Netherlands are key examples where social-democratic values coexist with deep financial markets due to these funded components.\n2.  **Circuit Breakers:** Generous \"pay-as-you-go\" public pensions and direct family benefits act as \"kryptonite\" for finance.
