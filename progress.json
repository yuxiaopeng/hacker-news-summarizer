    "url": "https://aimilios.bearblog.dev/reverse-engineering-sleep-mask/",
    "summary": "The article details a significant security and privacy flaw discovered in a \"smart\" sleep mask featuring EEG monitoring, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), and other sensory features. Seeking to replace the device's buggy official app, the author used Claude (Opus 4.6) to reverse-engineer the product’s communication protocol.\n\nBy decompiling the Flutter-based Android APK using specialized tools, Claude extracted hardcoded MQTT credentials and the specific byte structures for fifteen different commands. While this initially allowed the author to build a private web dashboard for their own device, it led to a disturbing discovery: the company’s message broker was open and shared universal credentials across all units.\n\nUpon connecting to the company’s MQTT broker, the author was able to:\n*   **Access Live Data:** View real-time EEG brainwave data from other active users around the world, identifying specific sleep stages like REM and deep sleep.\n*   **Remote Control:** Send commands back to these devices, potentially allowing a stranger to trigger vibration, heat, or electrical impulses (EMS) on a sleeping user.\n\nThe author notified the unnamed manufacturer about these vulnerabilities, citing the incident as a stark warning regarding \"digital hygiene\" and IoT security. Crucially, the author highlights that the entire reverse-engineering process—including Bluetooth analysis, binary decompilation, and vulnerability discovery—was completed by the AI model autonomously in roughly 30 minutes. This underscores the growing capability of AI to rapidly identify and exploit critical flaws in consumer hardware.",

    "chinese_summary": "本文详述了在一款具备脑电图（EEG）监测、肌肉电刺激（EMS）及其他感官功能的“智能”睡眠眼罩中发现的重大安全与隐私缺陷。由于官方应用程序存在诸多漏洞，作者试图对其进行替换，并利用 Claude (Opus 4.6) 对该产品的通信协议进行了逆向工程。\n\n通过使用专业工具对基于 Flutter 开发的安卓 APK 进行反编译，Claude 提取了硬编码的 MQTT 凭据以及 15 种不同指令的具体字节结构。虽然这最初只是为了让作者能为自己的设备构建一个私有的 Web 控制面板，但随后却导致了一个令人不安的发现：该公司的消息代理（message broker）是开放的，且在所有设备上共用一套通用凭据。\n\n通过连接到该公司的 MQTT 代理，作者能够：\n*   **访问实时数据：** 查看全球其他活跃用户的实时脑电图数据，识别快速眼动期（REM）和深层睡眠等特定睡眠阶段。\n*   **远程控制：** 向这些设备发送指令，这可能允许陌生人在用户睡眠时远程触发振动、加热或电脉冲（EMS）。\n\n作者已就这些漏洞通知了这家未具名的制造商，并称此次事件是针对“数字卫生”和物联网（IoT）安全的一次严正警告。关键在于，作者强调整个逆向工程过程——包括蓝牙分析、二进制反编译和漏洞发现——均由 AI 模型在约 30 分钟内自主完成。这凸显了 AI 在快速识别和利用消费级硬件关键缺陷方面日益增强的能力。"

    "url": "https://ziglang.org/devlog/2026/#2026-02-13",
    "summary": "The Zig devlog from early 2026 outlines several major advancements in the language’s standard library and workflow tools:\n\n**I/O and Evented Runtime**\nZig has landed `io_uring` (Linux) and Grand Central Dispatch (macOS) implementations for `std.Io.Evented`. Based on userspace stack switching (fibers), these allow developers to swap between threaded and evented I/O effortlessly without changing application logic. While currently experimental due to performance regressions and missing diagnostics, they represent a move toward a unified, swappable I/O architecture.\n\n**Package Management Enhancements**\nTwo significant updates improved the dependency workflow. First, fetched packages are now stored in a project-local `zig-pkg` directory, facilitating offline builds and easier \"tinkering\" with dependency source code. A global cache also stores compressed versions to support future peer-to-peer sharing. Second, a new `--fork=[path]` CLI flag allows developers to globally override specific dependencies with local source checkouts. This simplifies the process of fixing ecosystem breakages without immediately modifying build scripts.\n\n**Windows Native API Transition**\nThe standard library is moving away from the Win32 API (`kernel32.dll`) in favor of the lower-level Native API (`ntdll.dll`). The goal is to eliminate bloat, unnecessary heap allocations, and hidden failure modes introduced by high-level wrappers. Key examples include a more reliable entropy implementation that avoids problematic DLL loading and the use of `NtReadFile`/`NtWriteFile`, which provides better integration with task cancellation and asynchronous handles.\n\n**Zig libc**\nBrief mention is made of ongoing progress on the `zig libc` implementation by community contributors.\n\nTogether, these updates focus on increasing Zig’s reliability, reducing external dependencies, and providing a more flexible environment for systems programming.",
    "chinese_title": "Zig – io_uring 与 Grand Central Dispatch 的 std.Io 实现已合并",
    "chinese_summary": "2026 年初的 Zig 开发日志概述了该语言标准库和工作流工具的几项重大进展：\n\n**I/O 与事件化运行时**\nZig 已经为 `std.Io.Evented` 实现了 `io_uring` (Linux) 和 Grand Central Dispatch (macOS) 支持。基于用户态栈切换（fiber），这些实现允许开发者在线程化 I/O 和事件化 I/O 之间轻松切换，而无需更改应用逻辑。虽然目前由于性能回退和诊断功能缺失仍处于实验阶段，但它们代表了向统一、可切换的 I/O 架构迈进的重要一步。\n\n**包管理增强**\n两项重大更新改进了依赖工作流。首先，获取的包现在存储在项目本地的 `zig-pkg` 目录中，这有利于离线构建，也更方便对依赖项源码进行“调试与修改”。全局缓存还会存储压缩版本，以支持未来的点对点（P2P）共享。其次，新增的 `--fork=[path]` 命令行标志允许开发者使用本地源码检出来全局覆盖特定的依赖项。这简化了在不立即修改构建脚本的情况下修复生态系统损坏的过程。\n\n**向 Windows Native API 迁移**\n标准库正从 Win32 API (`kernel32.dll`) 转向更底层的 Native API (`ntdll.dll`)。其目标是消除由高层封装引入的臃肿、不必要的堆分配以及隐藏的失败模式。关键示例包括：一种避免了有问题的 DLL 加载且更可靠的熵（entropy）实现，以及通过使用 `NtReadFile`/`NtWriteFile` 来提供与任务取消和异步句柄更好的集成。\n\n**Zig libc**\n简要提到了社区贡献者在 `zig libc` 实现方面取得的持续进展。\n\n总之，这些更新专注于提高 Zig 的可靠性、减少外部依赖，并为系统编程提供更灵活的环境。"

    "url": "https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/shades-of-halftone/",
    "summary": "\"Shades of Halftone\" explores the resurgence of pattern-based post-processing, specifically focusing on the halftone effect—an optical illusion that uses grids of varying dot sizes to simulate continuous tones. Historically a technical workaround for limited ink printing, it is now a versatile digital tool for adding texture and artistic flair to images, videos, and 3D scenes.\n\nThe author breaks down the technical implementation using GLSL shaders. The process begins with creating a distance-field-based circle and using the `fract` function to generate a repeating grid. To apply this effect to digital media, the underlying texture must be pixelated using the `floor` function to ensure each grid cell samples a consistent color. Authentic halftone behavior is achieved by scaling the dot radius based on the \"luma\" (brightness) of the underlying pixels.\n\nThe article highlights several creative variants beyond standard dots:\n*   **Staggered Grids:** Offsetting rows to increase dot density and reduce white space.\n*   **Dual Patterns:** Mixing standard dots with \"inverted\" squares (white dots on dark backgrounds) to better preserve detail in darker regions.\n*   **Ring Shapes:** Using concentric circles to create a \"low-res\" or terminal-like aesthetic.\n\nFinally, the author discusses multichannel halftoning, where separate grids are stacked for RGB or CMYK color channels. This leads to an exploration of Moiré patterns—visual interference artifacts caused by rotating or displacing overlapping grids. By mastering these mathematical techniques, developers and designers can transform simple geometric patterns into complex, evocative visual experiences.",

Traditional points-to analyses typically operate under a \"closed-world\" assumption, requiring the entire source code to be available to produce accurate results. When applied to partial programs, these methods often become either **unsound** (ignoring the effects of unknown external code) or **imprecise** (assuming external code can modify any memory location).\n\nThe authors propose a framework that balances soundness with practical precision.
