    "title": "Why We Migrated from Python to Node.js",
    "url": "https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/python-to-node",
    "summary": "Skald rewrote its backend from Python (Django) to Node.js (Express + MikroORM) just one week after launch, prioritizing scalability despite the conventional advice to focus on product-market fit first. The primary driver was the difficulty encountered with Python's asynchronous capabilities in Django, which proved cumbersome and unintuitive for handling the numerous asynchronous API calls to LLMs and embedding services required by their RAG API platform.\n\nThe author, experienced with async operations in Node.js, found Python's async support to be a \"patched on\" addition rather than a core feature, leading to complexities and performance bottlenecks. They explored alternatives like FastAPI but ultimately chose Node.js to unify their codebase, as their background worker service was already written in Node.\n\nThe migration resulted in approximately a 3x throughput improvement, and the ability to do concurrent processing. While they missed Django's ergonomics and ORM, they gained benefits like a unified codebase, better testing, and familiarity with MikroORM.  They acknowledged losing the richness of the Python ecosystem, especially in machine learning, but accepted this trade-off for the immediate gains in efficiency and maintainability. They were willing to accept any criticism of their decision, provided it led to them learning more about Python's async capabilities. They concluded that the rewrite was beneficial and a learning experience, sharing links to the pull requests for review.\n",
    "chinese_title": "我们为什么从Python迁移到Node.js",
    "chinese_summary": "Skald上线一周后，将其后端从Python (Django) 重写为 Node.js (Express + MikroORM)，尽管通常建议优先关注产品与市场的契合度，但他们优先考虑了可扩展性。 主要原因是Django中Python的异步能力难以满足需求，对于处理其RAG API平台所需的众多对LLM和嵌入服务的异步API调用来说，它显得笨重且不直观。\n\n作者对Node.js中的异步操作经验丰富，认为Python的异步支持是“打补丁”式的添加，而非核心功能，这导致了复杂性和性能瓶颈。 他们探索了FastAPI等替代方案，但最终选择了Node.js来统一代码库，因为他们的后台工作服务已经用Node.js编写。\n\n迁移后，吞吐量提高了约3倍，并实现了并发处理的能力。 虽然他们怀念Django的易用性和ORM，但他们获得了统一代码库、更好的测试以及对MikroORM的熟悉等好处。 他们承认失去了Python生态系统的丰富性，尤其是在机器学习方面，但接受了这种权衡，以换取效率和可维护性的即时提升。 他们愿意接受对其决定的任何批评，只要能让他们更多地了解Python的异步能力。 他们得出结论，重写是有益且是一次学习经验，并分享了pull request的链接以供审查。"

    "url": "https://github.com/joelseverin/linux-wasm",
    "summary": "This document describes a project providing scripts to build and run a Linux system on WebAssembly (Wasm). The project leverages several software components: LLVM (patched for GNU ld-style linker scripts), a Linux kernel (patched for Wasm architecture support, binfmt, and a web console driver), musl libc (patched for Wasm target support), BusyBox (patched for clang/wasm-ld compatibility and a Wasm defconfig), a minimal initramfs, and a runtime (JavaScript-based Wasm host example).\n\nThe build process involves downloading and patching these components, then compiling them using clang and wasm-ld. Key challenges include musl's incomplete Wasm support, and limitations within the Linux kernel build system that necessitate space-free paths for the cross-compiler installation. The resulting system is a Linux kernel that can execute .wasm files as executables within a Wasm environment.\n\nThe document provides instructions for running the build scripts directly on a host machine or within Docker containers. Two Docker container configurations are available: `linux-wasm-base` (a development environment with necessary tools) and `linux-wasm-contained` (for isolated builds). The provided `linux-wasm.sh` script manages downloads and builds, and offers options for selectively rebuilding components. The runtime provides example JavaScript code to initiate the Wasm environment and interact with the kernel.\n\nThe document also highlights the need to build Linux in NOMMU configuration due to Wasm's lack of an MMU and suggests using `-fPIC/-shared` for Wasm programs or a proxy for syscalls, noting tradeoffs between shared memory and memory protection.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores Robert Hooke's 1681 letter to Gottfried Leibniz, arguing it embodies a \"cyberpunk\" sensibility centuries before the genre existed. The author, who discovered the letter in the Royal Society archives, finds it significant because it demonstrates Hooke's engagement with Leibniz's \"Characteristica Universalis,\" a project to create a universal language for science capable of mechanizing reasoning. This idea, which Norbert Wiener saw as a precursor to cybernetics, is framed as a proto-computer programming language.\n\nThe article posits that Hooke's letter goes beyond mere cybernetics. While Leibniz envisioned a system for rational thought, Hooke foresaw the potential for this language to empower individuals and bypass restrictive authorities. He hoped a universally accessible system of thought would allow for the free exploration and testing of ideas without censorship, a key element of cyberpunk's do-it-yourself ethos.\n\nThe author connects Hooke's life experiences – a politically charged upbringing, a penchant for hands-on tinkering, and clashes with authority – to this vision. They argue that Hooke's belief in the liberating potential of mechanized reasoning, particularly in challenging established power structures, aligns him with the core tenets of cyberpunk.

Recognizing the limitations of existing approaches due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D data, Skyfall-GS leverages the readily available combination of satellite imagery for coarse geometry and open-domain diffusion models for high-quality textures.\n\nThe core innovation lies in synergizing these two data sources to create realistic 3D environments at the city-block scale, enabling real-time, immersive exploration. Skyfall-GS employs a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy. This progressive approach enhances the geometric completeness and photorealistic textures of the generated scenes, resulting in a higher quality output.\n\nEssentially, Skyfall-GS addresses the challenge of creating large-scale 3D urban environments by bypassing the need for extensive 3D annotation. Instead, it intelligently combines readily available satellite imagery with diffusion models to achieve a realistic and explorable 3D world. The results showcase improved geometric consistency across different viewpoints and more realistic textures compared to other methods.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses the author's frustration with Nextcloud's performance, specifically its slow loading times, even on decent hardware. The author attributes this sluggishness to the excessive amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed, often reaching 15-20 MB per page load, even though compressed it's still 4-5MB, which is too much for a web app.\n\nThe author identifies specific JavaScript bundles contributing to this bloat, like `core-common.js`, `NotificationsApp.chunk.mjs`, and the large app-specific JavaScripts for Calendar, Files, and Notes apps. He provides examples of how long it takes for these apps to load on a slower connection, highlighting the poor user experience. He cites the example of the Tasks app taking 5-10 seconds to load on an iPhone.\n\nThe author suspects the architecture of Nextcloud, with its emphasis on a unified experience through common libraries, is the root cause. He feels the functionality-to-bundle size ratio is off.\n\nTo address this, the author has started replacing some Nextcloud apps with lighter alternatives, such as Vikunja for tasks and Immich for photos, appreciating their significantly smaller JavaScript footprints and improved speed. While acknowledging the convenience of Nextcloud's feature set for other functionalities, he remains dissatisfied with its performance.\n\nThe author acknowledges potential reasons for this state, such as overworked development teams, but emphasizes the negative impact on user experience and accessibility. He concludes by recommending Alex Russell's work on web performance and the importance of considering these factors during development.\n",

    "title": "The Continual Learning Problem",
    "url": "https://jessylin.com/2025/10/20/continual-learning/",
    "summary": "This article discusses the challenges of continual learning, the ability of a model to continuously learn from new experiences without forgetting previous knowledge. The author identifies two key subproblems: **generalization** (learning important bits from data that can be applied in diverse future settings) and **integration** (incorporating new information without catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge).\n\nThe author introduces \"memory layers\" as a potential solution, arguing that they offer a good balance of targeted updates, high capacity, and adaptive integration. Memory layers replace feed-forward networks with a sparse attention mechanism that looks up information in a learned memory pool. This allows for targeted updates because only a small subset of memory slots are activated for each input.\n\nThe article contrasts memory layers with other approaches like in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), full finetuning, and parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and adapters. ICL suffers from context rot, RAG doesn't compress knowledge, full finetuning leads to forgetting, and PEFT methods often lack capacity. Memory Layers aim to address the limitations of these alternatives.\n\nThe author's research, \"Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning,\" demonstrates that finetuning memory layers is more effective than full finetuning and LoRA in continual learning scenarios, leading to significantly less forgetting when learning new facts. The method uses a TF-IDF-based approach to selectively finetune memory slots that are most relevant to the new data, ensuring targeted updates and preventing catastrophic forgetting. The research is motivated by the desire to move towards models that are \"always training\" and continuously improving.\n",

The author criticizes Pandoc's `--mathjax` option for relying on a CDN, making it unsuitable for offline use and vulnerable to server failures. While MathML is suggested for online use, SVGs are presented as the most portable and reliable solution for offline rendering.\n\nThe core of the article focuses on a method to convert LaTeX formulas into SVG images using MathJax and a headless browser environment. The author details their journey of exploring different approaches, including the now-defunct phantomjs and ultimately settling on jsdom due to recent performance improvements.\n\nThe article then provides a code snippet illustrating how jsdom is used to load HTML, inject MathJax scripts, configure MathJax, and finally serialize the modified DOM containing SVG representations of the math formulas back into HTML. Key code sections demonstrate how to load and run the `loader.js` script within the jsdom context, configure MathJax to output SVG and call the `my_exit()` function upon completion.  The `loader.js` script creates a mathjax script and appends it to the HTML.\n\nThe article concludes with an example of how to use the `mathjax-embed` script to convert a Markdown file containing LaTeX formulas into a standalone HTML file with embedded SVG images, ensuring offline functionality without external dependencies or JavaScript execution in the final document.

    "url": "https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-810-explicit-lazy-imports/104131?page=23",
    "summary": "This article snippet illustrates how to verify the lazy loading behavior proposed in \"PEP 810, Explicit lazy imports\" using `sys.modules` in Python. The key takeaway is that a `lazy import` doesn't immediately populate `sys.modules` with the imported module. This contrasts with a regular `import`, where the module is added to `sys.modules` upon import.\n\nThe example shows that after using `lazy import email`, accessing `sys.modules['email']` raises a `KeyError` initially. This confirms the module isn't loaded and registered in `sys.modules` yet. Only after the module is actually used (by referencing `email` directly) is it loaded into memory and added to `sys.modules`. Subsequently, accessing `sys.modules['email']` retrieves the loaded module object.\n\nThe snippet suggests using this behavior in unit tests, potentially within a subprocess, to confirm that lazy imports are working as intended and that modules are only loaded when needed. This is a crucial aspect of PEP 810, aiming to improve startup time by deferring module loading until it's absolutely necessary.\n",
    "chinese_title": "Python Steering Council unanimously accepts \"PEP 810, Explicit lazy imports\"",
    "chinese_summary": "本文片段展示了如何使用Python中的`sys.modules`来验证“PEP 810，显式惰性导入”中提出的惰性加载行为。 关键在于，`惰性导入`不会立即使用导入的模块填充`sys.modules`。 这与常规`import`形成对比，后者在导入时会将模块添加到`sys.modules`。\n\n该示例表明，在使用`lazy import email`之后，访问`sys.modules['email']`最初会引发`KeyError`。 这证实了该模块尚未加载并在`sys.modules`中注册。 只有在实际使用该模块（通过直接引用`email`）之后，它才会被加载到内存中并添加到`sys.modules`。 随后，访问`sys.modules['email']`会检索已加载的模块对象。\n\n该片段建议在单元测试中使用此行为（可能在子进程中）来确认惰性导入是否按预期工作，以及模块是否仅在需要时才加载。 这是PEP 810的一个关键方面，旨在通过延迟模块加载直到绝对必要时来缩短启动时间。"

Dissatisfied with existing Asciidoc converters, particularly the Ruby-based Asciidoctor due to its interpreted nature and Ruby's perceived limitations, they embarked on building a Rust-based solution.\n\nInspired by \"Crafting Interpreters,\" the author opted for a hand-written parser instead of using a lexing package like `pest`, aiming for better understanding and potential performance benefits. The process involved scanning the Asciidoc document into tokens, parsing these tokens into an Abstract Syntax Graph, and then using that graph for output.\n\nThe scanning phase involved creating a `TokenType` enum and a `Token` struct, handling intricacies like character boundaries for Unicode characters and emojis. The `Scanner` struct, implemented as an iterator, uses pattern matching to identify tokens. Unit testing, facilitated by the `rstest` crate, is extensive.\n\nThe parsing phase focuses on generating a spec-compliant Abstract Syntax Graph, leveraging Rust's `serde` and `serde-json` crates for serialization into JSON. The author chose to define a struct for each Asciidoc element type instead of using a more abstract approach. The article concludes with a glimpse into the structure of the inline elements.\n",

The primary interface is a single USB-C port handling power, HDMI, and USB, although high-speed connectors exist on the bottom for future expansion.\n\nThe device runs Arduino's App Lab, a unified IDE enabling Python on the Linux side and C++ on the MCU side. While the Linux performance is comparable to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ or Pi 4, it's not ideal for demanding tasks like web browsing. Power consumption is decent at 0.5-3W, but the Linux stack cannot be disabled to run solely the MCU.\n\nPriced at $44 for the 2GB version, it's not the best value SBC compared to faster alternatives like the Raspberry Pi 5 or Radxa X4. While marketed for \"modern AI at the edge,\" it's limited to smaller models and slower performance than competitors. The App Lab is an improvement for managing Python/C++ code, but still not as seamless as GPIO access on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nDespite potential drawbacks, the Uno Q maintains Arduino's open-source commitment with available schematics. Its niche lies in Arduino-centric courses or robotics pipelines benefiting from Linux for remote access and lightweight ML models, but the author doesn't see significant value for personal use outside the existing Arduino ecosystem.

    "summary": "The article details the author's frustrating experience with Google Cloud, where their company, SSLMate, has had its account suspended three times without prior notification. SSLMate uses Google Cloud to facilitate integrations with customer Google Cloud accounts for certificate validation and domain monitoring, employing a service account impersonation system that Google's documentation suggested.\n\nThe author emphasizes that this method is both secure (no long-lived credentials) and easy for customers to configure. However, Google's repeated suspensions disrupt this service, requiring extensive and frustrating communication with support to resolve. Each suspension involved different error messages and reinstatement processes, leaving the author uninformed about the reasons for the suspensions or how to prevent them.\n\nThe author explores alternative integration methods, specifically highlighting OpenID Connect (OIDC) as a more secure alternative to long-lived service account keys. However, Google's implementation of OIDC is deemed unnecessarily complex, involving a seven-step process that hinders usability.\n\nUltimately, the author argues that Google's capricious account suspensions and cumbersome OIDC setup force a trade-off between security, usability, and reliability when setting up cross-provider access. They pose a question of which two out of the three are most important. They are frustrated that Google isn't making OIDC easier to use, which would encourage a more secure alternative to storing keys.\n",

    "summary": "Oliver Cussen's article \"Fish in the Wrong Place\" explores the unintended ecological consequences of transplanting fish and implementing large-scale hydraulic engineering projects during the colonial era. The article highlights how seemingly beneficial interventions, such as introducing Asian carp to control weeds or stocking rivers with trout for sport, often led to ecological disruption and the decline of native species.\n\nThe piece also examines the role of hydraulic engineering in colonial projects, drawing on Corey Ross's \"Liquid Empire\" and the work of James C. Scott. Colonial powers sought to control and re-engineer waterways for agriculture, trade, and resource extraction. Examples include the conversion of mangrove forests in Bengal, the construction of irrigation systems in the Punjab, and failed projects like the Saharan sea plan. These endeavors frequently resulted in ecological damage, social upheaval, and unintended consequences such as increased vulnerability to natural disasters and displacement of indigenous populations.\n\nCussen discusses Scott's critique of \"high modernist\" state power and its tendency to impose simplified order on complex natural systems, referencing examples of Soviet and Tanzanian agricultural reforms as well as urban planning in Brazil and India. The article emphasizes that attempts to control rivers and manage the environment have often been counterproductive, leading to instability and \"planned chaos.\" Despite technological advancements, humans have struggled to fully control natural systems, and efforts to do so have frequently resulted in unforeseen and detrimental outcomes.\n",

This change is scheduled to begin rolling out on November 5, 2025, and will require users to log in again.\n\nThe switch to Chromium means the application will likely consume more system resources, specifically RAM, due to Chromium's resource-intensive nature. Beta testers have already experienced this change and observed increased RAM usage. While the previous native WhatsApp app had performance issues, it felt more integrated with Windows and used less memory. The Chromium-based version, however, may suffer from performance issues, work poorly offline, and have notification problems.\n\nMeta acknowledges that native apps generally offer better performance and reliability, but the decision to switch to Chromium likely stems from cost-saving measures. Using web code reduces development and maintenance costs as the same code works across platforms.

    "summary": "This article, titled \"When Models Manipulate Manifolds: The Geometry of a Counting Task,\" investigates how language models like Claude 3.5 Haiku learn perceptual tasks from text, specifically linebreaking in fixed-width text. The authors find that the model develops representations of position similar to \"place cells\" in mammals, using both discrete features and a one-dimensional \"feature manifold\" to track character count.\n\nThe model combines features representing the current position in the line and the total line width to estimate the distance from the end of the line and predict a newline. This computation is described as an \"attribution graph,\" showing how different features excite or inhibit each other.\n\nKey findings include:\n*   Integer counts are represented on 1-dimensional feature manifolds embedded in low-dimensional subspaces.\n*   Attention heads rotate one counting manifold to align it with another to detect line boundaries.\n*   Counts are positioned on near-orthogonal subspaces, allowing for linear separability in newline prediction.\n*   The curvature in the character count representation manifold is produced by multiple attention heads.\n\nThe authors validate their interpretations through interventions and ablations. They argue that using feature manifolds is an efficient way to represent scalar quantities and that studying tasks natural to language models can reveal general mechanisms. The research emphasizes the duality of features and geometry in understanding model behavior and the importance of reducing the \"complexity tax\" of interpretations. They introduce a synthetic dataset to systematically analyze linebreaking behavior.\n",

    "summary": "Patrick George's article \"Enjoy CarPlay While You Still Can\" discusses the growing trend of automakers, specifically General Motors, moving away from supporting Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in favor of their own proprietary in-car software. While CarPlay is a beloved and free feature that mirrors iPhone functionality on a car's screen, GM believes its own software can provide a superior user experience.\n\nHowever, this shift has significant implications for consumers. GM's software requires a separate data plan, opening the door for subscription-based features and data monetization, a growing trend in the automotive industry. Car companies see in-car technology as a new revenue stream, potentially charging for features like hands-free driving, remote start, and even selling user data.\n\nWhile some automakers remain committed to CarPlay, even enhancing it, the author suggests its days are numbered. Apple's ambition with CarPlay Ultra, which aims to control even more vehicle functions, is seen as a threat by car companies who don't want to become mere hardware providers for tech giants. Ultimately, the move away from CarPlay signals a future where drivers can expect to pay recurring subscription fees for various in-car technologies, adding another expense to their monthly bills.\n",

    "url": "https://wyounas.github.io/aws/concurrency/2025/10/30/reproducing-the-aws-outage-race-condition-with-model-checker/",
    "summary": "This article details how a race condition leading to an AWS outage, as described in a post-mortem, can be reproduced using a model checker (Spin). The author simplifies the incident involving DynamoDB's DNS management system (DNS Planner, DNS Enactor, and Route 53) and uses Promela to model the key components.\n\nThe model represents a DNS Planner creating plans and Enactors applying them to Route 53, including a cleanup process that deletes older plans. The potential race condition arises when one Enactor applies a newer plan, followed by another Enactor applying an older plan that's then deleted by the first Enactor's cleanup, leading to a DNS failure.\n\nTo uncover this, the author defines invariants, specifically that the DNS should never be deleted once a newer plan is applied. Spin identifies a violation, producing a trail file demonstrating the race condition. A second invariant, that the active plan must never be deleted, yields a similar result.\n\nThe article highlights the value of invariants in verifying system correctness and how model checking can expose subtle concurrency bugs. The solution involves executing the problematic statements atomically to prevent the race. The author provides the Promela code (with and without the fix) and instructions for running the model checker in a linked repository, emphasizing that the model is simplified due to a lack of AWS internal design details.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文详细介绍了如何使用模型检查器 (Spin) 重现一个导致 AWS 宕机的竞态条件，该竞态条件在事后分析报告中有所描述。作者简化了涉及 DynamoDB DNS 管理系统（DNS Planner、DNS Enactor 和 Route 53）的事件，并使用 Promela 对关键组件进行建模。\n\n该模型表示 DNS Planner 创建计划，Enactor 将其应用于 Route 53，包括删除旧计划的清理过程。当一个 Enactor 应用较新的计划，随后另一个 Enactor 应用较旧的计划，而该计划随后被第一个 Enactor 的清理过程删除时，就会出现潜在的竞态条件，从而导致 DNS 故障。\n\n为了发现这一点，作者定义了不变式，特别是 DNS 在应用较新的计划后绝不应被删除。Spin 识别到一个违反，生成一个轨迹文件，展示了竞态条件。第二个不变式，即活动计划绝不应被删除，产生类似的结果。\n\n本文强调了不变式在验证系统正确性方面的价值，以及模型检查如何暴露细微的并发错误。解决方案涉及原子性地执行有问题的语句，以防止竞争。作者提供了 Promela 代码（包括修复前和修复后的代码）以及在链接的存储库中运行模型检查器的说明，并强调由于缺乏 AWS 内部设计细节，该模型已得到简化。"

    "summary": "This arXiv article, titled \"Collatz-Weyl Generators: High Quality and High Throughput Parameterized Pseudorandom Number Generators\" by Tomasz R. Działa, introduces a new family of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) called Collatz-Weyl Generators. These generators are based on a combination of generalized Collatz mappings (related to the Collatz conjecture) and Weyl sequences.\n\nThe key claim is that these generators offer high-quality statistical properties, evidenced by passing stringent randomness tests used in research and standardization. Beyond quality, the paper highlights several important advantages:\n\n*   **Solid Mathematical Foundation:** The generators are built on established mathematical concepts.\n*   **High Throughput and Low Latency:** They are designed for efficient implementation.\n*   **Small Footprint:** The generators require minimal code or ASIC size.\n*   **Multiple Independent Streams:** The design supports the generation of independent random sequences.\n*   **Cryptographic Potential:** The generators hold potential for use in cryptographic applications.\n\nThe article is categorized under Computer Science > Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE).

    "summary": "This article demonstrates how to implement and work with Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in C, a language without built-in support for object-oriented or functional data structures typically used for ASTs. It showcases a tagged union approach using structs, enums, and unions to represent different node types within the AST (number, addition, multiplication, and main program).\n\nThe article outlines the challenges of C's syntax when creating AST nodes, particularly the need for explicit type casting and designated initializers. A vararg macro `AST_NEW` is introduced to reduce boilerplate and improve readability during AST construction.\n\nIt then illustrates how to operate on the AST with examples of pretty-printing, deallocation (memory management), and code generation (x86-64 assembly). The code generation example shows how to traverse the AST and emit corresponding assembly instructions for arithmetic operations.  The importance of compiler warnings (-Wswitch, -Wimplicit-fallthrough) for robust tagged union usage is emphasized.\n\nFinally, the article includes a bonus section presenting the same AST implementation and code generation example in OCaml, highlighting the conciseness and type safety advantages of functional languages for compiler development.\n",

This can compromise confidentiality and integrity. The 64-bit form of RDSEED is not affected.\n\nAMD plans to release mitigations via AGESA and microcode updates for affected products, with target release dates ranging from late October 2025 to January 2026, depending on the specific product line (EPYC, Ryzen, Embedded). Users are advised to contact their OEM for BIOS updates.\n\nUntil the official fix is available, the document outlines several software workarounds:\n\n1.  Utilize the 64-bit RDSEED instruction.\n2.  Mask the RDSEED CPUID flag to prevent software from using the flawed instruction.\n3.  Treat a returned value of 0 from RDSEED as a failure (CF=0) and retry the instruction.\n\nThe issue is tracked as CVE-2025-62626, with a CVSS score of 7.2 (High).

    "url": "https://www.cringely.com/2015/06/03/autodesks-john-walker-explained-hp-and-ibm-in-1991/",
    "summary": "This article analyzes the struggles of HP and IBM in 1991, drawing parallels to Autodesk's internal challenges described in founder John Walker's \"Final Days of Autodesk\" memo. The author argues that both HP and IBM are facing decline due to their focus on short-term profit margins to satisfy Wall Street, often at the expense of long-term investment and innovation. This short-sighted approach involves cost-cutting measures like layoffs and neglecting investment in new product development, which ultimately leads to declining sales and vulnerability to competitors.\n\nThe article highlights Walker's core argument: that prioritizing accounting rules and margin maintenance over strategic vision and employee feedback leads to poor decisions. Specifically, the piece explains how accounting practices can incentivize harmful behaviors, such as buying and then starving smaller companies for short-term profit, or cutting successful marketing programs due to how sales are recorded.\n\nThe author uses Autodesk as an example, illustrating how a successful major account program could paradoxically lead to budget cuts in marketing due to increased \"cost of sales\" on accounting ledgers. The piece criticizes HP and IBM for failing to listen to their employees, stifling innovation, and prioritizing short-term financial gains over long-term strategic investment, ultimately leading to a downward spiral. The central argument is that while managing margins is important, it shouldn't dictate strategic decisions at the expense of future growth and innovation.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文分析了惠普和IBM在1991年面临的困境，并将其与Autodesk创始人约翰·沃克在“Autodesk的末日”备忘录中描述的Autodesk内部挑战相提并论。作者认为，惠普和IBM都面临衰退，原因是他们为了满足华尔街，过于关注短期利润率，往往牺牲了长期投资和创新。这种目光短浅的做法包括裁员等削减成本的措施，以及忽视对新产品开发的投资，最终导致销售额下降和容易受到竞争对手的攻击。\n\n文章强调了沃克的核心论点：即优先考虑会计规则和利润维持，而不是战略愿景和员工反馈，会导致糟糕的决策。具体来说，文章解释了会计实务如何激励有害行为，例如为了短期利润而收购并扼杀小公司，或者因为销售记录方式而削减成功的营销计划。\n\n作者以Autodesk为例，说明了一个成功的重大客户计划如何因会计账簿上“销售成本”的增加而自相矛盾地导致营销预算削减。文章批评惠普和IBM未能倾听员工的意见，扼杀创新，并将短期财务收益置于长期战略投资之上，最终导致恶性循环。中心论点是，虽然管理利润很重要，但不应以牺牲未来增长和创新为代价来决定战略决策。"

    "url": "https://github.com/lusingander/serie",
    "summary": "Serie is a terminal UI application designed to provide a richer experience for viewing Git commit graphs than `git log --graph`. It renders commit graphs using terminal image display protocols like iTerm2 and kitty, offering a more visually appealing and informative representation of the commit history.\n\nThe tool aims to simplify Git log browsing without becoming a full-fledged Git client or having a complex UI. It supports different commit ordering algorithms (chronological and topological), configurable graph widths (single or double character cell), and allows preloading of graph images for smoother scrolling.\n\nSerie can be installed via Cargo, package managers like pacman (Arch Linux), Homebrew, pkgin (NetBSD) or by downloading pre-compiled binaries from the releases section.\n\nThe application offers customizable keybindings for navigation, searching, and displaying commit details.  Users can also configure custom commands to display output in a dedicated view, enabling integrations with external tools like `git diff`. The configuration options cover aspects like graph colors, date formats, UI element appearance, and keybindings.\n\nThe document details configuration, user command definition, and supported terminals, highlighting that terminal multiplexers and Sixel graphics are currently unsupported.  It also includes contribution guidelines and mentions that the project is licensed under the MIT license.\n",

    "summary": "Donald Raab's article \"Go Primitive in Java, or Go in a Box\" advocates for using primitive collections in Java to avoid the performance overhead of boxing primitives in standard Java collections. He criticizes the lack of native primitive collection support in Java, highlighting the inefficiency of boxing primitives for use in collections.\n\nRaab promotes Eclipse Collections as a solution, emphasizing its comprehensive support for primitive collections including List, Set, Stack, Bag, LazyIterable, Map, Interval, and String for all eight Java primitives. These collections are available in both mutable and immutable versions (except for Interval, String and LazyIterable).\n\nHe points out the design considerations and trade-offs made in Eclipse Collections, such as deliberately omitting `Boolean<V>Map` due to its design smell and suggesting the use of `Pair` instead. He also addresses the challenge of integrating lambdas with primitive collections, showcasing how Eclipse Collections uses custom Functional Interfaces (Procedure, Function, Predicate) to overcome the lack of generic type support for primitives.\n\nThe article concludes by encouraging Java developers to adopt Eclipse Collections' primitive collections to achieve better performance and memory efficiency. Raab stresses that while waiting for future Java enhancements like Project Valhalla might seem appealing, developers can leverage existing solutions like Eclipse Collections to \"go primitive\" immediately. The article provides links to blogs, code katas, and a book for further learning.\n",
