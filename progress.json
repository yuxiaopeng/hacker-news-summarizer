    "url": "https://antirender.com/",
    "summary": "Based on the title and premise of **Antirender**, here is a concise summary of the project’s main points:\n\n**Antirender** is a critique and visual methodology aimed at deconstructing the hyper-realistic, often misleading nature of contemporary architectural visualizations. Its primary objective is to \"see through the architectural BS\" by stripping away the artificial \"glossy shine\" that characterizes modern marketing renders.\n\nThe key information and main points include:\n\n*   **Critique of Visual Deception:** The project argues that standard architectural renderings have become overly reliant on flattering lighting, idealized weather conditions, and digital post-processing. These elements often mask a building's true form, material quality, and environmental impact.\n*   **Emphasis on Raw Reality:** By removing the \"gloss,\" Antirender focuses on the core architectural elements—geometry, massing, and spatial relationships—without the distractions of atmospheric effects or deceptive textures. \n*   **Honest Communication:** The movement advocates for a more transparent dialogue between architects, clients, and the public. It suggests that by presenting projects in a more grounded, less idealized state, architects can set realistic expectations and ensure that the final physical structure aligns with its digital representation.\n*   **Combatting \"Vaporware\" Architecture:** It serves as a tool to expose designs that may look stunning in a curated image but lack functional or structural integrity in reality.\n\nIn essence, Antirender promotes **visual honesty**, prioritizing the integrity of the architectural design over the polished, \"sellable\" aesthetic of the render.",

    "chinese_summary": "基于 **Antirender** 的标题和前提，以下是该项目要点的简要总结：\n\n**Antirender** 是一种批判性的视觉方法论，旨在解构当代建筑可视化中超写实且往往具有误导性的本质。其核心目标是通过剥离现代营销渲染图中典型的人造“华丽光泽”，来“看透建筑界的虚假噱头”。\n\n关键信息与要点包括：\n\n*   **批判视觉欺骗：** 该项目认为，标准的建筑渲染图已过度依赖讨喜的光影、理想化的天气条件和数字后期处理。这些元素往往掩盖了建筑的真实形态、材质质量和环境影响。\n*   **强调原始真实：** 通过去除“光环”，Antirender 专注于几何形状、体量和空间关系等核心建筑元素，而不受大气效果或欺骗性纹理的干扰。\n*   **诚实的沟通：** 该运动倡导建筑师、客户与公众之间进行更透明的对话。它建议通过以更务实、更少理想化的状态展示项目，建筑师可以设定切合实际的预期，并确保最终的实体结构与其数字表达相一致。\n*   **打击“空头支票”式建筑：** 它作为一个工具，用于揭露那些在精心修饰的图像中看起来惊艳、但在现实中缺乏功能或结构完整性的设计。\n\n本质上，Antirender 提倡**视觉诚实**，将建筑设计的本真性置于渲染图那经过打磨且“易于销售”的美学之上。"

    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/one-of-nasas-three-wb-57-aircraft-just-did-a-belly-landing-in-houston/",
    "summary": "On Tuesday morning, one of NASA’s three WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft performed an emergency \"gear-up\" landing at Ellington Field in Houston. Following a mechanical failure, the pilot successfully landed the aircraft on its fuselage; NASA confirmed that all crew members are safe and an investigation into the cause is underway.\n\nThe WB-57 is a specialized variant of the B-57 Canberra, an aircraft design dating back to the late 1940s. While originally utilized by the U.S. Air Force for bombing and high-altitude reconnaissance, NASA has operated a small fleet of these planes since 1972 for scientific research. Their unique ability to fly at altitudes up to 60,000 feet allows them to study hurricanes, collect cosmic dust, and monitor the atmospheric impact of rocket plumes.\n\nThe aircraft involved in the incident was one of only three in NASA’s current inventory, having been restored from an Air Force \"boneyard\" in 2013. Recently, these planes have been used to track SpaceX Starship launches and were scheduled to provide critical observation data for the upcoming Artemis II lunar mission. \n\nIt is currently unclear if the damaged plane can be repaired. If the aircraft is grounded permanently, it could impact NASA’s capacity to conduct high-altitude observations and monitor the Orion spacecraft’s reentry during future missions.",

    "url": "https://blog.globalping.io/we-have-ipinfo-at-home-or-how-to-geolocate-ips-in-your-cli-using-latency/",
    "summary": "This article introduces an open-source CLI tool designed to geolocate IP addresses by measuring physical latency rather than relying on potentially falsified public registry data. The author notes that many VPN providers spoof their locations in geofeeds (ARIN/RIPE); however, latency-based \"pinging\" from multiple global vantage points provides a much more accurate picture of an IP's true physical location.\n\nThe tool leverages **Globalping**, a community-powered network of over 3,000 probes. To identify a location, the tool executes a four-phase process:\n1. **Continent Detection:** Pings the target from all continents to find the lowest latency.\n2. **Country Detection:** Conducts higher-density testing within the winning continent.\n3. **State Detection:** If the target is in the US, it narrows the search to a specific state.\n4. **City Detection:** Identifies the closest major city hub based on the lowest recorded latency.\n\nTechnically, the author shifted from standard ICMP and TCP pings to **traceroute** analysis. By measuring the latency of the last available hop, the tool can accurately locate an IP even if the target network blocks ICMP traffic, as upstream providers usually do not.\n\nThe tool is designed for efficiency, using approximately 50 probes per phase to stay within the Globalping API's unauthenticated limits. While the author acknowledges that accuracy depends on probe density and that commercial algorithms may be more complex, the tool successfully verified \"spoofed\" IPs, such as a NordVPN address appearing as the Bahamas that was physically located in Miami. The project is open-source and encourages users to contribute by hosting their own probes.",
    "chinese_title": "我们家里的 ipinfo：如何利用延迟在命令行中实现 IP 地理定位",
    "chinese_summary": "本文介绍了一款开源命令行（CLI）工具，该工具旨在通过测量物理延迟来定位 IP 地址，而非依赖可能存在虚假的公共注册机构数据。作者指出，许多 VPN 服务商会在地理位置信息库（如 ARIN/RIPE）中伪装其位置；然而，通过全球多个观测点进行的基于延迟的“Ping”测试，可以更准确地反映 IP 的真实物理位置。\n\n该工具利用了 **Globalping**，这是一个由社区驱动、拥有超过 3000 个探测点的网络。为了确定位置，该工具执行以下四个阶段：\n1. **大洲检测：** 从各大洲向目标发送 Ping 请求，以寻找最低延迟。\n2. **国家检测：** 在延迟最低的大洲内进行更高密度的测试。\n3. **州级检测：** 如果目标位于美国，则将搜索范围缩小到具体的州。\n4. **城市检测：** 根据记录到的最低延迟，确定距离最近的主要城市中心。\n\n在技术层面，作者从标准的 ICMP 和 TCP Ping 转向了 **traceroute** 分析。通过测量最后一个可用跳数的延迟，即使目标网络屏蔽了 ICMP 流量，该工具也能准确定位 IP，因为上游供应商通常不会屏蔽此类流量。\n\n该工具专为高效设计，每个阶段使用约 50 个探测点，以确保在 Globalping API 的未认证限制范围内。尽管作者承认准确性取决于探测点的密度，且商业算法可能更为复杂，但该工具成功验证了“伪造”的 IP，例如一个 NordVPN 地址显示在巴哈马，但物理位置实际位于迈阿密。该项目目前已开源，并鼓励用户通过托管自己的探测点来做出贡献。"

Due to specific technical issues encountered on Debian 13 (as of December 2025), the guide recommends a reliable **two-step conversion process** rather than a single command:\n\n1.  **Intermediate Stage:** Convert the source video (e.g., .webm or .gif) into a **.y4m** file. During this step, the author suggests optimizing the file by limiting the framerate (e.g., 15 fps) and scaling the dimensions (e.g., 720p width) to keep the file size manageable.\n2.  **Final Encoding:** Encode the .y4m file into the final **.avif** container using the `libsvtav1` video codec. The recommended settings use a Constant Rate Factor (`-crf 30`) to balance quality and compression.\n\nWhile the author notes that a single-step command should theoretically work, the staged approach currently prevents encoding errors. Ultimately, the article positions AVIF as the go-to format for high-quality, lightweight web animations.",
