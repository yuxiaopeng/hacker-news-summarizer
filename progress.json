    "summary": "\"Growing up in ‘404 Not Found’\" explores the history and legacy of City 404, a secret nuclear base located in the Gobi Desert of Gansu province. Established in 1958, the city was omitted from maps for decades, serving as the hidden heart of China’s nuclear weapons program and the site where the country’s first atomic bomb was developed.\n\nAt its peak, City 404 was a self-contained microcosm housing nearly 100,000 people, including scientists, engineers, and their families. Despite its isolation and the harsh desert climate, the state provided residents with high-quality amenities, including schools, hospitals, theaters, and even a park with a zoo. The article highlights the unique childhood experience of those raised there: a life defined by extreme secrecy and geographical confinement, but also by a profound sense of community and security.\n\nThe city began to decline as the Cold War ended and the focus of the nuclear program shifted. In the mid-2000s, the majority of the population was relocated to the nearby city of Jiayuguan. Today, City 404 is largely a \"ghost town,\" characterized by decaying socialist-style architecture and abandoned playgrounds.\n\nUltimately, the story captures a sense of nostalgia for a \"lost\" era of Chinese history. It serves as a tribute to the \"Third Front\" generation—thousands of workers who lived in total anonymity and made immense personal sacrifices to advance China's military and scientific status. The city remains a haunting symbol of state secrecy and the human cost of national ambition.",

    "chinese_summary": "《在“404”长大》探讨了位于甘肃戈壁滩上的秘密核基地——404城的历史与传承。该城市始建于1958年，在地图上消失了数十年，是中国核武器计划的隐秘中心，也是中国第一颗原子弹的诞生地。\n\n在鼎盛时期，404城是一个自给自足的微型社会，容纳了包括科学家、工程师及其家属在内的近10万人口。尽管地处偏远且沙漠气候恶劣，国家仍为居民提供了高质量的生活设施，包括学校、医院、剧院，甚至还有一座带动物园的公园。文章重点讲述了在那里长大的孩子独特的童年经历：这种生活既受限于极度的保密和地理隔绝，又充满深厚的社区归属感和安全感。\n\n随着冷战结束和核计划重心的转移，这座城市开始衰落。2000年代中期，大部分居民搬迁到了附近的嘉峪关市。如今，404城在很大程度上已成为一座“鬼城”，随处可见破败的社会主义风格建筑和荒废的游乐场。\n\n最终，这个故事捕捉到了对中国历史上一个“迷失”时代的怀旧情怀。它向“三线”一代致敬——成千上万的建设者隐姓埋名，为提升中国的军事和科研地位做出了巨大的个人牺牲。这座城市依然是国家机密的特殊象征，也见证了国家雄心背后所付出的个人代价。"

    "summary": "**Hacker News Prime** is a conceptual parody that reimagines the interface of the popular technology news aggregator, Hacker News, through the lens of number theory and mathematics.\n\nThe content mimics the site’s familiar header and footer layout but replaces standard categories with terms related to prime numbers. Key navigation links include classifications such as **Mersenne**, **Sophie Germain**, **Fermat**, and **palindrome primes**. The typical list of stories is replaced by numeric sequences and mathematical notation (such as $e \\leq k^2$).\n\nThe footer follows this theme by substituting standard startup-related links with mathematical alternatives. For example, the \"Apply to YC\" (Y Combinator) link is replaced with \"Apply to $\\zeta$\" (referencing the Riemann zeta function), while other links are changed to \"Pure Math,\" \"Deterministic,\" and \"Security.\"\n\nOverall, the article presents a stylistic \"math-themed\" version of the Hacker News platform, catering to enthusiasts of pure mathematics and prime number theory.",

    "summary": "The **tc-ematch(8)** manual page describes \"extended matches,\" a flexible infrastructure used in Linux traffic control (`tc`) to enhance the filtering capabilities of the **basic**, **cgroup**, and **flow** filters. These matches allow for complex packet classification by combining multiple criteria using logical operators (**and**, **or**, **not**) and parentheses.\n\nKey match modules include:\n\n*   **cmp**: Performs arithmetic comparisons (eq, lt, gt) on packet data at specific offsets and layers (link, network, or transport).\n*   **meta**: Matches packet metadata, such as Netfilter marks (`nf_mark`), VLAN tags, interface indices, system load averages, or kernel socket buffer attributes.\n*   **nbyte**: Searches for specific byte sequences or strings at a defined offset within the packet.\n*   **u32**: Provides bitmask-based matching on packet data, similar to the standalone u32 filter.\n*   **ipset**: Checks if packet headers (like source or destination IP) match memberships in a defined `ipset`.\n*   **ipt**: Allows the use of standard `xtables` (iptables) match extensions within the `tc` framework.\n*   **canid**: Specifically designed to match Controller Area Network (CAN) frame identifiers.\n\n**Usage Considerations:**\nBecause the ematch syntax uses parentheses for grouping expressions, users must escape them in the shell to prevent command-line interpretation errors. The utility is part of the **iproute2** suite and is essential for advanced network traffic shaping, allowing administrators to create highly specific rules for packet handling based on both content and system metadata.",

    "url": "https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/27/",
    "summary": "In \"Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML,\" Aaron T. Grogg argues that while JavaScript (JS) has traditionally been the workhorse of web interactivity, developers should now prioritize native HTML and CSS features for common UI components. Reducing JS dependency improves performance by lowering the browser's download, decompression, and memory processing requirements.\n\nGrogg highlights four specific areas where native HTML can replace JS:\n\n*   **Accordions / Expanding Content:** The `<details>` and `<summary>` elements provide built-in show/hide functionality. By using the `name` attribute, developers can create \"exclusive accordions\" where only one panel opens at a time, mimicking radio button behavior.\n*   **Autofilter Suggestions:** Combining an `<input>` with a `<datalist>` creates a functional dropdown that filters options as the user types. This works for text, numbers, and time-based inputs without the need for custom filtering scripts.\n*   **Modals and Popovers:** The new `popover` and `popovertarget` attributes allow elements to be toggled easily. These support \"light dismissal\" (closing via the Escape key or clicking outside) and offer different modes like `auto`, `hint`, and `manual` to control how overlays interact with one another.\n*   **Offscreen Navigation:** By utilizing the Popover API alongside CSS transformations (like `translate`), developers can create side menus and drawers. This approach leverages native browser positioning and provides easy access to backdrop styling.\n\nGrogg concludes that while JS remains essential for complex tasks, handing off UI management to native HTML and CSS results in leaner, more efficient websites. By respecting the browser's native capabilities, developers can deliver better user experiences with less code.",
    "chinese_title": "用纯 HTML 替换 JavaScript",
    "chinese_summary": "在《仅用 HTML 替代 JavaScript》一文中，Aaron T. Grogg 指出，虽然 JavaScript (JS) 传统上一直是实现网页交互的核心工具，但开发者现在应优先为常见 UI 组件采用原生的 HTML 和 CSS 特性。减少对 JS 的依赖可以通过降低浏览器的下载、解压和内存处理负担来提升性能。\n\nGrogg 重点介绍了原生 HTML 可以替代 JS 的四个具体领域：\n\n*   **手风琴/可展开内容：** `<details>` 和 `<summary>` 元素提供了内置的显示/隐藏功能。通过使用 `name` 属性，开发者可以创建“排他性手风琴”（即一次只能打开一个面板），从而模拟单选按钮的行为。\n*   **自动筛选建议：** 将 `<input>` 与 `<datalist>` 结合使用，可以创建一个在用户输入时自动过滤选项的功能性下拉框。这适用于文本、数字和时间输入，无需编写自定义筛选脚本。\n*   **模态框与弹出框：** 新的 `popover` 和 `popovertarget` 属性支持轻松切换元素状态。它们支持“轻量化关闭”（通过 Esc 键或点击外部关闭），并提供 `auto`、`hint` 和 `manual` 等模式来控制覆盖层之间的交互。\n*   **离屏导航：** 通过结合使用 Popover API 和 CSS 变换（如 `translate`），开发者可以创建侧边菜单和抽屉组件。这种方法利用了浏览器的原生定位能力，并能方便地设置背景遮罩样式。\n\nGrogg 总结道，虽然 JS 对于处理复杂任务仍然必不可少，但将 UI 管理交给原生 HTML 和 CSS 可以构建出更精简、更高效的网站。通过充分利用浏览器的原生能力，开发者可以用更少的代码提供更好的用户体验。"
