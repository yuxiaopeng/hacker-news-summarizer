    "title": "Python 3.15’s interpreter for Windows x86-64 should hopefully be 15% faster",
    "url": "https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/no-longer-sorry.html",
    "summary": "Ken Jin reports that Python 3.15 is expected to deliver a significant performance boost, specifically a geometric mean speedup of **15% on Windows x86-64** and approximately **5% on macOS AArch64**.\n\nThe primary driver of this improvement is the transition to a **tail-call threaded interpreter**. Historically, C-based interpreters used \"switch-case\" or \"computed goto\" loops. However, CPython’s interpreter loop grew to over 12,000 lines of code, which caused modern compilers (like MSVC and Clang) to struggle with optimization heuristics. Specifically, compilers often refused to inline small, trivial functions within such a massive loop to avoid further increasing code size.\n\nBy using the `musttail` attribute—recently introduced in Clang and now available experimentally in **Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC)**—each bytecode handler can be written as its own function that \"tail-calls\" the next. This structure mandates that the compiler perform the call without growing the stack, effectively resetting compiler heuristics. As a result, the compiler can successfully inline helper functions again, leading to much more efficient machine code.\n\n**Key highlights include:**\n*   **Performance:** `pyperformance` benchmarks show speedups ranging from 15% for large libraries to nearly 80% for certain microbenchmarks.\n*   **Collaboration:** The breakthrough is the result of a partnership between CPython developers and the Microsoft MSVC team.\n*   **Availability:** While the feature is currently experimental and requires building from source using Visual Studio 2026, the team plans to include it in the official Python 3.15 release. \n*   **Adoption:** The `uv` package manager already utilizes similar tail-calling optimizations for Python 3.14 on macOS.\n\nThis change represents a major shift in how the Python interpreter is compiled, moving away from monolithic loops toward a more modular, compiler-friendly architecture.",
    "chinese_title": "Python 3.15 的 Windows x86-64 解释器有望提速 15%",
    "chinese_summary": "Ken Jin 报告称，Python 3.15 预计将带来显著的性能提升，具体而言，Windows x86-64 平台上的几何平均加速比达 15%，macOS AArch64 平台上约为 5%。\n\n此次提升的主要驱动力是向“尾调用线程解释器”（tail-call threaded interpreter）的转型。从历史上看，基于 C 语言的解释器使用“switch-case”或“计算跳转”（computed goto）循环。然而，CPython 的解释器循环代码量已增长至超过 12,000 行，这使得现代编译器（如 MSVC 和 Clang）难以处理其优化启发式算法。具体来说，为了避免代码体积进一步膨胀，编译器通常会拒绝在如此庞大的循环中内联细小的基础函数。\n\n通过使用 `musttail` 属性（最近引入 Clang，目前正在 Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC) 中进行实验性支持），每个字节码处理程序都可以编写为独立的函数，并“尾调用”下一个函数。这种结构强制编译器在不增加堆栈的情况下执行调用，从而有效地重置了编译器的启发式算法。结果是，编译器可以再次成功内联辅助函数，从而生成更高效的机器代码。\n\n**关键要点包括：**\n*   **性能：** `pyperformance` 基准测试显示，大型库的提速达 15%，某些微基准测试的提速则接近 80%。\n*   **协作：** 这一突破是 CPython 开发团队与微软 MSVC 团队合作的结晶。\n*   **可用性：** 虽然该功能目前处于实验阶段，且需要使用 Visual Studio 2026 进行源码构建，但团队计划将其纳入 Python 3.15 的正式版本。\n*   **应用：** `uv` 包管理器已经在 macOS 上的 Python 3.14 中采用了类似的尾调用优化。\n\n这一变化代表了 Python 解释器编译方式的重大转变，即从单一的庞大循环转向更模块化、对编译器更友好的架构。"

    "summary": "Researchers from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Cleveland VA have published a study in *Cell Reports Medicine* challenging the long-held belief that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is irreversible. The study demonstrates that restoring the brain’s energy balance can achieve full neurological recovery in animal models, even after significant disease progression.\n\nThe research identifies the decline of **NAD+**, a critical cellular energy molecule, as a primary driver of Alzheimer’s. While NAD+ levels naturally drop with age, the team found that the decline is much more severe in both human AD brains and mouse models. By administering a pharmacological agent called **P7C3-A20**, researchers were able to restore NAD+ balance in mice with advanced AD pathology.\n\nThe results were significant: mice expressing both amyloid and tau mutations showed a reversal of brain damage and a **full recovery of cognitive function**. This recovery was confirmed by the normalization of p-tau 217, a recognized clinical biomarker for Alzheimer's.\n\nSenior author Andrew A. Pieper emphasized that this discovery represents a paradigm shift from merely slowing the disease to potentially reversing it. Importantly, Pieper distinguished their approach from over-the-counter NAD+ precursors, which can reach \"supraphysiologic\" levels that may promote cancer. P7C3-A20 instead helps cells maintain a proper balance under stress. \n\nThe findings offer a \"message of hope\" that the damaged brain may be capable of self-repair. The team is now looking toward human clinical trials and investigating whether this energy-restoration approach could be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "chinese_summary": "凯斯西储大学、大学医院（University Hospitals）以及克利夫兰退伍军人事务部（Cleveland VA）的研究人员在《细胞报告医学》（Cell Reports Medicine）上发表了一项研究，挑战了长期以来认为阿尔茨海默病（AD）不可逆转的传统观点。该研究表明，即使在疾病显著进展后，通过恢复大脑的能量平衡，也能在动物模型中实现神经功能的完全恢复。\n\n研究指出，关键细胞能量分子 NAD+ 的下降是阿尔茨海默病的主要驱动因素。虽然 NAD+ 水平会随年龄增长自然下降，但研究团队发现，在人类 AD 患者大脑和模型小鼠中，这种下降程度要严重得多。通过施用一种名为 P7C3-A20 的药物，研究人员成功恢复了患有晚期 AD 病理小鼠的 NAD+ 平衡。\n\n实验结果意义重大：同时具有淀粉样蛋白和 Tau 蛋白突变的小鼠表现出脑损伤的逆转，且认知功能完全恢复。通过对 p-tau 217（一种公认的阿尔茨海默病临床生物标志物）恢复正常指标的检测，进一步证实了这一康复效果。\n\n资深作者安德鲁·A·皮珀（Andrew A. Pieper）强调，这一发现代表了科研范式的转变——即从单纯减缓疾病进展转向潜在的逆转疾病。重要的是，皮珀将他们的方法与非处方 NAD+ 前体进行了区分，后者可能使 NAD+ 达到“超生理”水平，从而可能诱发癌症；而 P7C3-A20 则是帮助细胞在压力下维持适当的能量平衡。\n\n这些发现传递了一个“希望的信号”，即受损的大脑可能具备自我修复的能力。该团队目前正致力于开展人体临床试验，并研究这种能量恢复方法是否可应用于其他神经退行性疾病。"

    "summary": "In \"I Sell Onions on the Internet,\" Peter Askew recounts his unconventional journey from a \"web guy\" to the owner of a successful niche e-commerce business. A domain name enthusiast, Askew purchased **VidaliaOnions.com** at an auction in 2014 for $2,200. Following his philosophy—inspired by William Faulkner—that a domain name (like a character) should guide its own development, he decided to transform the URL into a \"farm-to-door\" delivery service modeled after Harry & David.\n\nLacking agricultural experience, Askew reached out to the Vidalia Onion committee and partnered with Aries Haygood, a veteran Georgia farmer. While Haygood managed the farming and packing, Askew handled the digital infrastructure, marketing, and customer service. The venture was an immediate success: their first season in 2015 saw over 600 orders, far exceeding their conservative estimate of 50.\n\nThe business grew through a mix of digital and traditional marketing, including a phone order hotline and strategic sponsorships. Despite significant hurdles—most notably a $10,000 loss on faulty shipping boxes that nearly ended the project—Askew persisted. By the fifth season, the business had become a staple for fans of the \"caviar of sweet onions,\" with even competitors referring customers to his site.\n\nUltimately, Askew emphasizes the gratification of choosing \"purpose over profit.\" By connecting a traditional agricultural product with modern digital strategy, he found fulfillment in becoming \"The Vidalia Man,\" proving that even the most \"analog\" industries can thrive on the internet when driven by the right domain and a commitment to customer service.",

It focuses on modern Linux hardware (DRM/GBM) and eliminates legacy server driver interfaces.\n*   **Security:** By utilizing Zig’s safety features and automatic protocol parsing, Phoenix aims to prevent illegal memory behaviors. It implements client isolation, requiring explicit permissions for sensitive actions like screen recording, while providing \"dummy data\" to maintain compatibility with restricted applications.\n*   **Modern Technology:** The project addresses long-standing Xorg limitations by offering proper multi-monitor support (individual refresh rates and VRR), HDR capabilities, and built-in compositing to prevent screen tearing.\n*   **Compatibility:** While currently only running in a \"nested\" mode for development, it aims to support Wayland applications via bridges and can serve as an alternative to Xwayland.\n\n**Non-Goals:**\nPhoenix is not intended to replace Xorg for legacy systems. It explicitly ignores archaic features like indirect GLX, endian-swapped clients, and ancient font operations.\n\n**Current State:**\nThe project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for general use.
