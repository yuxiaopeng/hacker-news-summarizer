    "title": "GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers",
    "url": "https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/",
    "summary": "AI detection platform GPTZero has identified over 100 confirmed hallucinated citations across 51+ papers accepted for the prestigious NeurIPS 2025 conference. This discovery follows a similar investigation into ICLR 2026 submissions, highlighting a growing \"tsunami of AI slop\" in academic publishing.\n\nBy scanning 4,841 accepted papers, GPTZero uncovered numerous instances of fabricated authors, non-existent titles, and fake DOIs or arXiv IDs. These errors successfully bypassed the peer review process, despite each paper being evaluated by at least three reviewers. The report attributes this systemic failure to a \"submission tsunami\" fueled by generative AI and publication pressure; NeurIPS submissions have surged by 220% since 2020, growing from roughly 9,500 to over 21,000. \n\nThe findings are particularly significant because NeurIPS policies explicitly state that hallucinated citations are grounds for paper rejection or revocation. Despite these flaws, the identified papers were among the 24.5% accepted, meaning they beat out approximately 15,000 other submissions. \n\nGPTZero emphasizes that their goal is not to criticize conference organizers, but to illuminate a critical vulnerability in the peer review pipeline. The report concludes that the current academic infrastructure is \"outnumbered and outgunned,\" struggling to maintain rigor against AI-generated challenges it was never designed to defend against.",
    "chinese_title": "GPTZero在NeurIPS 2025录用论文中发现100个新幻觉",
    "chinese_summary": "AI检测平台GPTZero在顶尖会议NeurIPS 2025录用的51多篇论文中，识别出了超过100处经证实的幻觉引用。此前，针对ICLR 2026投稿的类似调查也发现了类似情况，凸显了学术出版领域日益严峻的“AI垃圾海啸”问题。\n\n通过对4,841篇录用论文的扫描，GPTZero发现了大量伪造的作者、不存在的标题以及虚假的DOI或arXiv ID。尽管每篇论文都经过至少三名审稿人的评估，这些错误仍成功躲过了同行评审。报告将这一系统性失败归因于由生成式AI和发表压力引发的“投稿海啸”：自2020年以来，NeurIPS的投稿量激增了220%，从约9,500篇增长至21,000多篇。\n\n这些发现意义重大，因为NeurIPS的政策明确规定，幻觉引用是拒稿或撤稿的理由。尽管存在上述缺陷，这些涉事论文依然跻身24.5%的录用名单，意味着它们击败了约15,000篇其他投稿。\n\nGPTZero强调，其目的并非批评会议组织者，而是为了揭示同行评审流程中的关键漏洞。报告总结称，当前的学术基础设施已经“势单力薄，难敌攻势”，正竭力在AI生成的挑战面前维持严谨性，而其设计初衷并非为了抵御此类挑战。"

    "summary": "The **Qwen3-TTS** family has been officially open-sourced, marking a major advancement in accessible, high-fidelity audio synthesis. Developed by the Qwen team, this suite of models provides a comprehensive toolkit for sophisticated speech tasks, focusing on three core pillars: **Voice Design, Voice Cloning, and Speech Generation.**\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n\n*   **Voice Design:** This feature allows users to craft bespoke vocal personas by defining specific attributes such as gender, age, and tonal characteristics. It enables the creation of unique identities for virtual assistants or characters without requiring an existing human recording.\n*   **Voice Cloning:** The models offer high-fidelity, zero-shot cloning. By providing a short audio sample (often only a few seconds), users can replicate a specific voice with remarkable accuracy, capturing the nuances of the original speaker’s timbre and style.\n*   **High-Quality Generation:** Qwen3-TTS delivers natural, human-like prosody and emotional expression. It significantly reduces the \"robotic\" artifacts common in older TTS systems, making it suitable for long-form content like audiobooks and podcasts.\n*   **Multilingual Support:** Continuing the Qwen tradition of broad linguistic coverage, the models are designed to handle multiple languages and code-switching with ease.\n\n**Significance:**\nBy open-sourcing these advanced models, the Qwen team is democratizing state-of-the-art audio AI. This move provides developers and researchers with a powerful, transparent alternative to proprietary services (such as ElevenLabs or OpenAI’s audio tools), fostering innovation in personalized AI communication, accessibility tools, and localized content production.",
