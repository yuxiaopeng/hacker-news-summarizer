    "summary": "The Xiaomi MiMo report introduces MiMo-7B, a series of 7B language models specifically designed and trained for enhanced reasoning capabilities. The core idea is that effective reasoning in language models relies on both tailored pre-training and strategic post-training.\n\nMiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained from scratch using a focused data preprocessing pipeline, synthetic reasoning data, and a three-stage data mixture strategy with approximately 25 trillion tokens. A key pre-training innovation is Multiple-Token Prediction (MTP) to boost performance and inference speed.\n\nPost-training involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). A carefully curated dataset of 130K math and code problems with rule-based verification is used for RL training. To address sparse rewards in code, a difficulty-driven code reward is introduced. A data re-sampling strategy is implemented for easy problems to improve sampling efficiency. The RL infrastructure features a Seamless Rollout Engine for accelerated training and validation.\n\nThe report showcases four models: MiMo-7B-Base, MiMo-7B-RL-Zero (RL trained from Base), MiMo-7B-SFT, and MiMo-7B-RL (RL trained from SFT). Evaluation results demonstrate that MiMo-7B-RL achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's o1-mini in math and code reasoning benchmarks and even surpasses larger 32B models in some areas. The models are available on Hugging Face. The report provides deployment instructions for vLLM and Hugging Face inference, recommending a specific vLLM fork and an empty system prompt.\n",

    "summary": "DeepSeek-Prover-V2 is a new open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4. It builds upon DeepSeek-V3 and uses a novel approach involving recursive theorem proving and reinforcement learning to integrate informal and formal mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe model is trained using a two-stage process. First, DeepSeek-V3 is used to decompose complex theorems into subgoals, formalizing the proof steps in Lean 4. A smaller 7B model proves these subgoals, and the resulting formal proofs are combined with DeepSeek-V3's chain-of-thought reasoning to create a synthetic cold-start dataset. Second, the prover model is fine-tuned on this dataset and then undergoes reinforcement learning using correct/incorrect feedback.\n\nThe resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong capabilities in neural theorem proving. The article also introduces ProverBench, a new benchmark dataset of 325 problems, including formalized questions from AIME competitions and textbook examples, designed for comprehensive evaluation across high-school and undergraduate mathematics.\n\nDeepSeek-Prover-V2 is released in two model sizes (7B and 671B) and both the models and the ProverBench dataset are available for download on Hugging Face.

He was working at Amdahl Corp. porting UNIX to the mainframe when he was contacted by Scott McNealy, having been recommended by Bill Joy.\n\nThe author was already familiar with the hot technologies of the time - UNIX and Motorola 68000 - and was actively seeking a startup opportunity. He'd interviewed with Valid Logic Systems and Fortune Systems, but wasn't passionate about their respective CAD and word processing focuses. Crucially, his brothers, working at Xerox SDD and PARC, respectively, provided him with inside knowledge of workstations.\n\nA friend's raving about the SUN project at Stanford and its processor board piqued his interest. When McNealy called, his familiarity with the SUN board impressed McNealy. After interviewing with McNealy, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Vinod Khosla, and learning that Bill Joy was involved, he was sold on Sun. A positive reference check on Bechtolsheim from his brother at Xerox PARC sealed the deal.\n\nHe accepted an offer as \"director of devices\" and started on May 3rd, alongside Bruce Smith (#9). His first task involved debugging a disk driver issue that prevented UNIX from shipping on Sun-1s. Within a year, Sun had grown significantly, shipping workstations with BSD UNIX, 68010s, and 10Mb Ethernet.

It leverages the GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm to train models based on their own experiences, minimizing code changes by offloading the RL training loop to the ART backend.\n\nART comprises a client and a server. The client, OpenAI-compatible, facilitates communication between ART and the user's existing codebase, handling message passing and completion requests. The server, running independently with GPU support, manages the complexities of inference and training. The training loop involves agent workflows performed by the user's code using the ART client. Completion requests are routed to the ART server which runs the LoRA version of the model in vLLM. The resulting trajectories are then assigned a reward by the user to indicate the agent's performance. Trajectories are grouped on the server, training occurs using GRPO, and then a new LoRA is saved and loaded into vLLM.\n\nART supports most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models. The framework is currently in alpha and welcomes contributions. It builds upon projects like Unsloth, vLLM, trl, and SkyPilot. Notebook examples for training agents in 2048, Temporal Clue, and Tic Tac Toe are provided.\n",

The authors, Singh et al., identify that undisclosed private testing practices give an unfair advantage to certain providers, enabling them to selectively disclose their best scores after testing multiple model variants and retracting undesirable results. Meta, for example, tested 27 private LLM variants before releasing Llama-4.\n\nFurthermore, the study reveals that proprietary closed models are sampled more frequently in battles and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight alternatives. This leads to significant data access asymmetries. Providers like Google and OpenAI have disproportionately benefited from arena data, receiving significantly more data exposure than all open-weight models combined.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that access to Chatbot Arena data confers a significant performance advantage, with even limited additional data yielding substantial performance gains. This dynamic encourages overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than genuine general model improvement.\n\nThe paper concludes by offering actionable recommendations for reforming the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework to promote fairer and more transparent benchmarking within the field of AI. The research highlights the importance of addressing biases in benchmark design and data access to ensure that leaderboards accurately reflect model capabilities.\n",

The tests involved running concurrent read and write transactions on lists of unique integers, designed to detect violations of isolation levels.\n\nThe primary finding is that Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL does not ensure Snapshot Isolation, despite the \"Repeatable Read\" isolation level being advertised. Jepsen observed G-nonadjacent cycles, including Long Fork anomalies, which are violations of Snapshot Isolation. These anomalies were observed consistently across various PostgreSQL versions supported by AWS.\n\nThe analysis suggests that RDS for PostgreSQL might provide Parallel Snapshot Isolation instead, a weaker consistency model. This means read transactions may disagree on the order of executed transactions, potentially leading to inconsistent views of the data. The issue seems to involve read-only secondary instances.\n\nThe report recommends that users of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL carefully examine their transaction structures for potential Long Fork issues or design experiments to verify their intended data invariants. A possible workaround to regain Snapshot Isolation might be to use only the writer endpoint or ensure all safety-critical transactions include at least one write.\n\nThe report emphasizes that this was a preliminary exploration and cannot definitively prove the absence of other issues.

It also improves the official U.S. time, distributed via radio and the internet, crucial for various sectors like telecommunications and finance.\n\nThe clock's development involved significant engineering advancements, including rebuilding the microwave cavity. Rigorous testing ensures its accuracy, accounting for factors like temperature and magnetic fields. NIST-F4's frequency measurements are accurate to within 2.2 parts in 10 to the 16th, comparable to the world's best.\n\nNIST-F4 and another fountain clock, NIST-F3, operate most of the time, sending data to BIPM to calibrate Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and steer the NIST time scale, UTC(NIST). This improves the reliability and performance of U.S. timekeeping.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the concept of \"induced atmospheric vibration\" in the context of a recent power outage on the Iberian Peninsula. The term, initially cited as a cause, is poorly defined and lacks readily available scientific literature. The article investigates possible explanations, considering factors like temperature variations, corona discharges, reactance in high-voltage power lines, and the interaction of these elements.\n\nSeveral experts and users contribute to the discussion, questioning the validity of \"induced atmospheric vibration\" as the primary cause. Some suggest that temperature variations can affect conductor parameters and create frequency imbalances, leading to cascading disconnections in the power grid. Others point to potential modeling deficiencies in modern power systems, which rely on rapidly reacting inverter-based systems that can become unstable due to unexpected reactance caused by atmospheric conditions.\n\nUltimately, the article implies that the initial explanation of \"induced atmospheric vibration\" might be an oversimplification or even a misnomer. While atmospheric conditions can influence the behavior of power grids, the outage likely stemmed from a complex interplay of factors, including grid design, equipment sensitivity to frequency fluctuations, and the rapid response of modern inverter-based systems. The claim of atmospheric phenomena being the cause has since been withdrawn. Other potential causes discussed by experts included cascading disconnections of power plants caused by an imbalance in frequency.\n",

Founded by Manoug Manougian at Haigazian College in Beirut, the LRS overcame limited resources through ingenuity and dedication, garnering national pride and even attention from foreign powers.\n\nDriven by Manougian's vision of peaceful technological advancement, the LRS developed sophisticated rockets like the Cedar-4, which reached low Earth orbit. However, the program faced increasing challenges due to escalating geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts, and pressure from international powers concerned about the potential militarization of the technology.\n\nManougian's refusal to develop weapons technology and the Lebanese military's growing interest in the rockets' military applications created a conflict of interest. Ultimately, external pressure from the US, France, and the UK led to the program's shutdown in 1967, with Manougian leaving for the United States. The LRS faded into obscurity, further obscured by the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nThe article highlights the missed opportunities for Lebanon had the program continued, including potential industrial development, regional leadership in satellite technology, and improvements in education and infrastructure. It also emphasizes Manougian's visionary leadership and the tragedy of his erasure from Lebanese national memory, suggesting that his idealism may have inadvertently contributed to the program's demise.

    "summary": "On January 29, 2025, a tragic plane crash at Reagan National Airport resulted in the deaths of all 64 people aboard American Airlines Flight 5342 and the crew of an Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash, the worst domestic aviation disaster in nearly a quarter-century, occurred over the Potomac River as the helicopter and plane collided.\n\nThe article highlights the concept of \"visual separation,\" a common aviation practice where pilots navigate around other aircraft independently of air traffic controller guidance. The Black Hawk crew requested and was granted visual separation, but failed to execute it effectively, either missing the passenger jet or being unable to maneuver safely.\n\nThe article emphasizes that the crash wasn't due to a single error, but rather a breakdown of multiple safety systems and redundancies. The diagrams within the article point to the proximity of the helicopter route to the flight path of the planes using Runway 33, which would require a decrease in vertical separation if the helicopter were further from the eastern bank of the river.\n\nThe reporters reviewed government documents and audio recordings and interviewed experts. Their investigation points to failures in visual separation as a contributing factor, highlighting a known risk in aviation that, in this instance, led to catastrophic consequences.\n",

    "summary": "The article critiques the current tech industry trend of CEOs mandating an \"AI-first\" approach across their companies, comparing it to the previous \"return to office\" push. The author argues that forcing employees to use AI, especially by incorporating it into performance reviews, is unnecessary and even counterproductive.\n\nThe author contends that AI is most beneficial for those who are less skilled in a particular area. Forcing highly skilled employees to use AI tools implies a lack of faith in their abilities and a misunderstanding of how technology should be adopted organically. The author uses their own experience with coding to illustrate this point, stating that AI tools help them compensate for their lack of expertise but wouldn't necessarily improve the work of highly skilled developers.\n\nThe \"AI-first\" mandate, according to the author, is more about signaling within the tech CEO and VC circles than improving actual productivity. These leaders are engaging in groupthink, trying to stay in vogue with the latest trend, often at the expense of employee autonomy and judgment. A better approach would be to offer secure, well-integrated AI tools and allow employees to choose whether and how to use them based on their individual needs and workflows.\n\nThe author advocates for a more balanced and \"normal\" approach to technology adoption, criticizing the \"tech optimism\" that blindly promotes startups and ignores innovations from other sectors. They suggest that if AI tools are truly valuable, they will be adopted naturally by those who find them useful, without the need for forced implementation or hyperbolic claims. Ultimately, the author predicts that these AI mandates will be used to evaluate the CEO's leadership skills rather than the worker's productivity.\n",

    "url": "https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2025/blog/sparse-autodiff/",
    "summary": "This article introduces Automatic Sparse Differentiation (ASD), a technique that accelerates the computation of Jacobians and Hessians in machine learning by leveraging their sparsity (where most coefficients are zero). While standard Automatic Differentiation (AD) is widely used, ASD is less common due to its development outside the ML research ecosystem.\n\nThe article first reviews traditional AD, including forward and reverse modes for Jacobian computation, emphasizing the use of matrix-free Jacobian operators to avoid explicitly storing large intermediate Jacobian matrices. It then delves into ASD, explaining that its core idea is to compute multiple structurally orthogonal columns (or rows) of the Jacobian matrix with a single Jacobian-vector product (JVP) or vector-Jacobian product (VJP). This is possible because Jacobian operators are linear maps, and the sum of structurally orthogonal columns can be uniquely decomposed.\n\nSince the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian is initially unknown, ASD employs a four-step process: 1) Pattern detection to identify the sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix. 2) Coloring algorithms to group orthogonal columns (or rows) together. 3) Compressed AD to compute JVPs or VJPs using the coloring information. 4) Decompression to assign values to the correct entries in the Jacobian matrix. By avoiding unnecessary computations on zero elements, ASD offers significant performance benefits, especially for high-dimensional problems with sparse Jacobians and Hessians.\n",

    "summary": "This article introduces Bamba, an open-source hybrid large language model (LLM) developed by IBM Research that combines the strengths of transformers and state-space models (SSMs) to overcome the \"quadratic bottleneck\" of traditional transformers. Transformers, while effective, suffer from increasing computational costs as context length grows due to their self-attention mechanism and the need to store the KV (key value) cache. SSMs offer a solution by maintaining a compressed \"hidden state\" that summarizes past information, leading to faster inference.\n\nBamba-9B, IBM's implementation, demonstrates the potential of this hybrid approach by achieving comparable accuracy to similar-sized transformers while running at least twice as fast due to reduced memory requirements of the KV cache. It builds on previous innovations in SSM research, including work by Albert Gu and Tri Dao, and leverages the Mamba2 architecture.\n\nIBM is making Bamba entirely open-source, including training recipes, data, and a quantization framework, in collaboration with Red Hat to optimize vLLM for SSMs. Early benchmarks show Bamba performing on par with Meta's Llama-3.1 8B, despite being trained on less data. While currently trained on 4,000-token sequences and capable of handling 32,000-token conversations, IBM aims to extend its context window to 1 million tokens and achieve even faster inference speeds. The goal is to provide an efficient and accessible LLM for enterprise use and foster community-driven improvements.\n",

The author highlights several key difficulties:\n\n*   **Composability:** Optimizations often interact in unpredictable ways, requiring extensive testing of various combinations to avoid pessimizations.\n\n*   **Continuity:** Many optimizations involve cut-off boundaries and parameters that need meticulous tuning through rebenchmarking after even small code changes to avoid significant performance loss.\n\n*   **Incompatibility:** Hardware limitations, such as cache size and register pressure, can thwart optimizations, forcing developers to make difficult choices and compromises.\n\n*   **Compilers:** Despite advancements, compilers often fail to perform the high-level, abstract optimizations a human developer would recognize, instead focusing on zero-cost abstractions. They can also make poor decisions regarding register allocation. Developers must analyze disassembly and profiling data to guide the compiler effectively.\n\n*   **Documentation:** The author criticizes the lack of comprehensive documentation for newer architectures like Apple Silicon, making optimization a reverse-engineering exercise.\n\nThe author concludes that performance optimization requires exploring numerous possibilities, working with imperfect tools, and dealing with various external constraints.

    "summary": "Tyler Glaiel argues that programming languages are missing a fundamental control flow construct for tree traversal, analogous to `for` or `foreach` loops for linear data structures. He proposes a `for_tree` construct to fill this gap, simplifying common tree operations and reducing errors compared to recursive function implementations.\n\nThe `for_tree` loop mirrors the syntax of a traditional `for` loop, with `init`, `condition`, and `branch` sections. The `branch` section dynamically generates child nodes for traversal. Glaiel illustrates this with C++-ish examples, showing how `for_tree` can iterate through a binary tree's nodes, printing their values.\n\nHe highlights advantages like readability, reduced boilerplate, and the ability to use `break`, `continue`, and a new `prune` statement within the loop body. `Prune` allows early termination of sub-tree exploration based on specific node properties, offering efficiency gains.\n\nThe article also addresses the limitations of range-based for loops, particularly when dealing with implicit trees (e.g., generating strings recursively) or when pruning is required. While a breadth-first search (BFS) variant could exist, the author prioritizes the simplicity and stack-friendliness of depth-first search (DFS) for the primitive construct.\n\nGlaiel concludes by addressing the argument that existing iterators suffice, emphasizing the power of abstracting tree traversal for implicit tree-like relationships found in many programming scenarios beyond explicit tree data structures.

    "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-the-internet-left-4chan-behind",
    "summary": "This article explores the rise and fall of 4chan, tracing its origins as an anonymous online forum where users could share unfiltered content, including pornography, pirated files, and controversial opinions. The author reflects on their early experiences with the site and its role in shaping the internet's culture of \"shitposting,\" memes, and online putdowns.\n\nWhile 4chan once held a unique position as a haven for political incorrectness, incel culture, and extremist ideologies, the article argues that its influence has waned as similar content has proliferated across other platforms, including Truth Social, Parler, and X. Content moderation policies on these newer sites have loosened, allowing conspiracy theories and graphic imagery, pushing 4chan to the periphery.\n\nThe author highlights how 4chan's real-time one-upmanship has become ingrained in the online landscape, influencing platforms like X, TikTok, and video podcasts. Even official accounts, like the White House's, have adopted a trolling aspect, demonstrating the pervasive influence of 4chan's edgelord culture.\n\nThe article also touches on 4chan's recent hacking and server issues, revealing its aging infrastructure and vulnerability. Ultimately, it suggests that while 4chan may persist in some form, the kind of extremism it once fostered is now happening in private digital niches like Discord, Telegram, and Signal, making it harder to trace. The article concludes by asserting that 4chan's sensibility endures, shaping online discourse and reflecting a dark corner of our collective digital consciousness.\n",

    "summary": "In his essay, Craig argues that science fiction has a responsibility to shift away from its current dystopian focus and reignite optimism for the future. He observes that the genre, once a source of inspiration for progress like the space race, has become dominated by cautionary tales that now mirror real-world problems, leading to a sense of hopelessness.\n\nDrawing inspiration from J.R.R. Tolkien's view of escapism as a \"duty\" and Milton Friedman's concept of making the \"politically impossible\" \"politically inevitable,\" Craig advocates for science fiction to present new, positive visions of the future. He contends that by exploring and promoting these ideas, science fiction can help establish them as viable alternatives to current political and economic systems, which he believes are facing crises.\n\nCraig emphasizes that this isn't about advocating for specific political ideologies, but rather fostering a culture of hope and ambition for a better world. He urges writers and readers to imagine the future they desire, share their optimistic visions with passion and love, and ultimately inspire the creation of a brighter reality. He calls for science fiction to inspire us to love the future and realize it just like it inspired us to fly to the moon.\n",

These limitations include a lack of support for interdependent data frame validation, soft validation with failure introspection, test data generation, and strict static typing.\n\nDataframely provides a declarative way to define data frame schemas, including column types, constraints (e.g., primary keys), and cross-column validation rules using polars expressions. It allows for validation using `validate` (which raises exceptions for invalid rows) and `filter` (which returns valid rows and failure information for introspection).\n\nA key feature is the ability to define \"Collections\" to represent and validate interdependent data frames, applying rules across multiple data frames linked by common keys. Dataframely also enhances code readability and maintainability by adding schema information to data frame type hints. This improves static type checking with mypy.\n\nBeyond validation, Dataframely enables automatic SQL schema generation and sample data generation for unit testing based on the defined schemas. QuantCo has successfully integrated dataframely into its data pipelines, reporting improved code legibility, robustness, and testability.

To counter electromagnetic interference, Q-CTRL integrates machine learning software that filters out magnetic noise. In testing, the device maintained accuracy within a few hundred yards during 300-mile flights, significantly outperforming inertial navigation systems and other backup methods like Doppler radar and lidar.\n\nWhile requiring detailed magnetic field maps and prominent magnetic landmarks for optimal performance, the technology's accuracy and lack of detectable signal make it attractive to defense and aerospace entities.

    "summary": "This Asimov Press article, \"China's Clinical Trial Boom,\" by Hiya Jain, explores the significant increase in clinical trials initiated in China, rising from just over 600 in 2017 to nearly 2,000 by 2023. This surge is contrasted with the plateauing of clinical trial numbers in the United States.\n\nThe article attributes China's growth to policy reforms streamlining approvals and lowering barriers to market entry for new drugs, including priority review, conditional approvals, and an \"implied license\" policy allowing automatic authorization within 60 days if regulators don't object. China also joined the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and began accepting overseas clinical trial data, reducing the need to repeat studies. Amgen's XGEVA approval exemplifies this.\n\nThis efficiency has led to increased international investment and a rise in original, new drugs originating in China, nearing American totals. Furthermore, Chinese companies are increasingly licensing molecules to Western pharmaceutical companies after conducting initial (Phase I) trials in China at lower costs.\n\nThe author argues that China's regulatory reforms have created a faster and cheaper environment for drug development, fostering a higher learning rate in the Chinese biopharma ecosystem. While acknowledging the American system's pioneering role in pharmaceutical development, the article advocates for reforms in the U.S. to \"democratize\" clinical research by expanding Medicaid coverage, simplifying paperwork, and allowing fair compensation. This is inspired by the \"Clinical Trial Abundance Initiative.\" It also highlights that countries that adapt their frameworks to expedite start-up times, recognize credible foreign data, and balance the tradeoff between sufficient oversight and innovation-friendly policies stand to capture the next wave of drug discoveries.\n",

    "summary": "Richard Negus's \"Art of the Hedgerow\" explores the dynamic history of English hedgerows and their reflection in art, arguing that their existence has always been subject to socio-economic forces rather than a static, pre-1945 ideal of biodiversity. He challenges the narrative of a continuous decline since WWII, asserting that hedgerows have fluctuated with agricultural needs and economic climates since at least 2500 BC.\n\nNegus uses sporting art to illustrate this point. He contrasts John Ferneley's paintings from the 1820s, depicting a recession-stricken countryside with sparse hedges, to Robert Dighton's 1796 mezzotint showcasing prosperous, well-hedged farmland during a period of agricultural revolution. These artworks demonstrate how hedgerow density and maintenance mirror the economic health and agricultural practices of their time.\n\nWhile acknowledging the post-WWII hedgerow loss due to agricultural rationalization, Negus emphasizes that this is not an isolated event. He concludes that the English landscape, including its hedgerows, is a man-made and ever-changing construct, heavily influenced by policy decisions made by the government. The article cautions against romanticizing a fixed pre-war landscape, highlighting the ongoing interplay between human intervention, agricultural demands, and the visual representation of the countryside.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "理查德·尼格斯《树篱的艺术》探索了英国树篱的动态历史及其在艺术中的反映，认为它们的存在始终受社会经济力量的影响，而非二战前静态的生物多样性理想。他挑战了二战后树篱持续衰退的说法，断言自至少公元前2500年以来，树篱就随着农业需求和经济环境而波动。\n\n尼格斯利用体育艺术来说明这一点。他将约翰·费恩利的1820年代绘画作品（描绘了经济衰退的乡村和稀疏的树篱）与罗伯特·迪顿1796年的铜版腐蚀凹版画（展示了农业革命时期繁荣、树篱茂密的农田）进行了对比。这些艺术品表明，树篱的密度和维护反映了当时的经济状况和农业实践。\n\n在承认二战后因农业合理化导致的树篱损失的同时，尼格斯强调这并非孤立事件。他总结说，包括树篱在内的英国景观是人为的、不断变化的构造，深受政府政策决定的影响。该文章告诫人们不要美化战前固定的景观，强调了人为干预、农业需求和乡村视觉表现之间持续的相互作用。"

    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/republicans-want-to-tax-ev-drivers-200-year-in-new-transport-bill/",
    "summary": "A proposed transportation bill by House Republicans includes a new annual federal motor vehicle registration fee that disproportionately impacts electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid drivers. Battery EVs would be taxed $200 annually, while hybrids would pay $100. Owners of large, polluting trucks would pay significantly less, and not until 2030. These fees are set to increase annually with inflation until 2034/2035, while commercial and farm vehicles are exempt.\n\nThe bill aims to address the Highway Trust Fund shortfall, projecting an extra $110 billion by 2035, but critics argue that other tax cuts and spending initiatives will still leave the fund $222 billion short. States that refuse to collect the new fees risk losing 125% of the estimated revenue in federal transportation funding.\n\nRepublican chairperson Sam Graves claims the fees are a matter of fairness, ensuring EV drivers contribute to highway maintenance. However, critics like the Sierra Club argue the bill penalizes cleaner vehicles, undermines clean transportation initiatives, and prioritizes billionaire tax cuts over public health and environmental concerns. They advocate for incentivizing EV adoption rather than imposing punitive fees. The author also points out that many states already charge EV registration fees, and the bill hints at the potential end of the federal gasoline tax.\n",

Qwen3 demonstrates strong performance in coding, math, and general capabilities, outperforming or rivaling models like DeepSeek-R1, Grok-3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro.\n\nA key feature is its hybrid thinking mode, offering both \"Thinking Mode\" for complex reasoning and \"Non-Thinking Mode\" for quick responses, allowing users to control the model's computational reasoning budget. Qwen3 also boasts extensive multilingual support, covering 119 languages and dialects.\n\nThe model's capabilities have been optimized for coding and agentic applications, including strengthened support for MCP. Qwen3 was pre-trained on 36 trillion tokens across 119 languages, incorporating web data, PDF documents, and synthetic data generated by Qwen2.5 models. The pre-training process involved three stages, focusing on basic language skills, knowledge-intensive data, and long-context handling.\n\nPost-training involved a four-stage pipeline to develop the hybrid thinking model, including long chain-of-thought cold start, reasoning-based reinforcement learning, thinking mode fusion, and general RL. Deployment is supported through frameworks like SGLang and vLLM, and tools like Ollama and LMStudio are recommended for local use. A soft switch mechanism using `/think` and `/no_think` allows users to control thinking mode in multi-turn conversations. Qwen-Agent is recommended for leveraging Qwen3's tool calling capabilities. Future work aims to further enhance the model's capabilities in pursuit of AGI and ASI.\n",

This economic reversal is attributed to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade policies, including tariff announcements and policy shifts.\n\nWhile the headline decline was partly due to measurement quirks, it reflected the real impact of Trump's policies. Consumers rushed to purchase goods before tariffs went into effect, and businesses stockpiled materials in anticipation of a trade war. This behavior skewed the economic figures, giving the appearance of decline.\n\nThe article emphasizes that this economic snapshot occurred *before* further, more sweeping tariffs were announced in April, which subsequently escalated into a full-blown trade war with China and caused turmoil in financial markets. The data on consumer spending and business investment suggested that growth slowed in the first quarter but didn't contract.\n",

    "summary": "This \"Show HN\" introduces PyXL, a custom hardware processor that directly executes Python code in silicon, eliminating the need for interpreters, JIT, or operating systems. It compiles Python code into a custom assembly and runs it on a pipelined processor built from scratch.\n\nThe key benefit of PyXL is its speed and determinism. A GPIO roundtrip takes only 480ns on PyXL, compared to around 15,000ns on a MicroPython-based PyBoard, demonstrating a performance increase of 30-50x when normalized for clock speed. This speed improvement stems from the direct hardware execution of Python bytecode, bypassing the overhead of a software-based virtual machine.\n\nThe project currently runs on a Zynq-7000 FPGA (Arty-Z7-20 dev board) with the PyXL core operating at 100MHz. While the ARM CPU handles setup and memory, the Python code itself executes entirely in hardware.\n\nPyXL's determinism makes it suitable for real-time use cases, such as real-time control systems, ML inference in sensor loops, robotics, and embedded industrial systems where timing and reliability are crucial. By enabling direct Python execution on hardware, PyXL promises a new level of responsiveness and precision for Python in embedded systems.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "\"Show HN\"：PyXL，一款直接在硅上执行Python代码的定制硬件处理器，无需解释器、JIT或操作系统。它将Python代码编译成定制汇编，并在从头构建的流水线处理器上运行。\n\nPyXL的主要优势在于其速度和确定性。在PyXL上，一个GPIO往返仅需480ns，而基于MicroPython的PyBoard上则需要大约15,000ns，当按时钟速度标准化后，性能提升了30-50倍。这种速度的提升源于Python字节码的直接硬件执行，绕过了基于软件的虚拟机开销。\n\n该项目目前在Zynq-7000 FPGA（Arty-Z7-20开发板）上运行，PyXL核心以100MHz的频率运行。虽然ARM CPU处理设置和内存，但Python代码本身完全在硬件中执行。\n\nPyXL的确定性使其适用于实时用例，例如实时控制系统、传感器环路中的ML推理、机器人技术以及对时间和可靠性至关重要的嵌入式工业系统。通过在硬件上直接执行Python，PyXL有望为嵌入式系统中Python带来全新的响应能力和精度。"

A refactor inadvertently caused the app to repeatedly download a 250MB update file every 5 minutes, instead of stopping after the initial download.\n\nThe issue was compounded by many users leaving the app running in the background for weeks, triggering constant, unnecessary downloads. This resulted in approximately 9 million downloads and over 2 petabytes of traffic on Google Cloud in a single month.\n\nThe author highlights the scale of the problem, with traffic reaching up to 1GiB/s. The problem went unnoticed because the company lacked cost alerts and wasn't regularly monitoring cloud usage. The incident was only discovered when the author's credit card blocked the charge.\n\nThe excessive traffic also impacted users, with one user even having their internet contract terminated due to the extreme data usage. The company offered to cover the user's costs, ultimately resolving the issue with the provider.\n\nThe author emphasizes the importance of setting up cloud cost alerts, carefully writing auto-updater code (and cost-generating code in general), implementing server-side signals for forced updates, and regularly monitoring cloud infrastructure. The incident served as a painful lesson in the potential consequences of seemingly minor coding errors and the importance of robust monitoring and alerting systems.\n",

    "summary": "This 2025 article from NYU Langone Health, published in eBioMedicine, links exposure to the phthalate DEHP, used in plastics, to over 365,000 heart disease deaths globally in 2018. The study, analyzing health and environmental data from 200 countries, found that populations in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East bore a disproportionately large share of these deaths, comprising about half of the total. India had the highest death toll (39,677). Researchers estimate the economic burden from these deaths to be between $510 billion and $3.74 trillion.\n\nPrior research by the team linked phthalates to premature deaths in older Americans, but this is the first global estimate of cardiovascular mortality attributable to these chemicals. DEHP exposure is believed to trigger inflammation in the heart's arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Researchers suggest that higher exposure rates in rapidly industrializing regions with fewer manufacturing restrictions may explain the disparity in death rates.\n\nThe authors advocate for global regulations to reduce phthalate exposure, particularly in affected regions. They caution that the study doesn't prove DEHP directly causes heart disease and didn't account for other phthalates or age groups. Future research will track the impact of reduced phthalate exposure on mortality rates and examine other health concerns linked to these chemicals.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate truly random outputs, focusing on two experiments: simulating a fair coin toss and generating random numbers between 1 and 10 to assess even/odd distribution. The author acknowledges the limited statistical significance due to small sample sizes but conducts the experiments \"for fun.\"\n\nIn the coin toss experiment, all tested models (various OpenAI and Anthropic versions) exhibited a bias towards \"heads,\" with OpenAI models showing a significantly stronger bias than Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Claude had the least bias (58% heads), while one OpenAI model, \"o1,\" showed an extreme bias of 99% heads. Chi-square tests indicated that all models' biases, except Claude's, were statistically significant, suggesting an inherent preference rather than random chance.\n\nThe second experiment, generating numbers to assess odd/even distribution, revealed a strong bias toward odd numbers in most models, particularly Claude 3.7 Sonnet (97% odd). Interestingly, GPT-4.5-preview achieved a perfectly balanced 50/50 split. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of the biases, with Claude showing the most extreme. GPT-4.1 also exhibited a slight bias, but towards even numbers.\n\nThe author notes the surprising contrast in Claude's performance, exhibiting unbiased coin tosses but strong odd number preference. The experiments highlight that while LLMs theoretically understand randomness, their training data can introduce unexpected and statistically significant biases.\n",

The study concludes that such cuts would significantly harm the economy in the long run.\n\nKey findings include substantial negative impacts on GDP, investment, and government revenue. A 25% reduction in public R&D spending could decrease GDP by a magnitude similar to the decline experienced during the Great Recession. A more drastic 50% cut could result in an average loss of $10,000 per American compared to projected historical GDP trends.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlights the detrimental impact on federal government revenue. A 25% cut in R&D spending is projected to reduce revenue by approximately 4.3% annually, while a 50% cut could lead to an 8.6% annual decrease. In essence, the report argues that investing in public R&D is crucial for economic growth and government revenue generation, and that cutting this funding would have severe and lasting negative consequences.\n",

Keep in mind this is speculative and may not fully reflect the article's specific arguments.\n\nA likely summary would discuss how momentum investing, the strategy of buying assets that have performed well recently and selling assets that have performed poorly, generates positive returns. The article likely explores potential explanations for this phenomenon.\n\nIt might discuss behavioral finance reasons, such as herding behavior, where investors follow trends and amplify price movements, leading to under-reaction and delayed information incorporation. This under-reaction creates an opportunity for momentum strategies to profit.\n\nAnother potential explanation is related to information diffusion. Information about a company's prospects often spreads gradually, allowing the initial price increase to be sustained as more investors become aware of the positive news.\n\nThe article may also touch upon risk-based explanations, suggesting that momentum strategies are inherently riskier and that the excess returns are compensation for bearing this risk. This could involve exposure to macroeconomic factors or other systematic risks.\n\nFinally, the article might highlight the limitations of momentum strategies, such as the potential for sudden reversals and the impact of transaction costs.
