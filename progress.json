    "title": "Zed editor switching graphics lib from blade to wgpu",
    "url": "https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/46758",
    "summary": "This GitHub pull request thread documents the proposal and ongoing discussion regarding replacing the **blade** graphics library with **wgpu** for the Linux version of the Zed editor’s UI framework (GPUI).\n\n**Key Motivations:**\nThe proponent, *zortax*, argues that the current `blade` library is unstable and causes significant issues for Linux users, specifically mentioning frequent freezes on Nvidia hardware and Wayland compositors. By switching to `wgpu`—the industry standard for the Rust graphics ecosystem—Zed can benefit from the collective improvements of the wider community (such as the Bevy game engine) and ensure more reliable long-term maintenance. A primary driver for the change is that `blade` is currently perceived as unmaintained, leaving critical bugs unaddressed for months.\n\n**Maintainer and Community Feedback:**\n*   **Platform Scope:** Zed maintainers expressed interest in the switch for Linux but stated they do not currently plan to replace native renderers for macOS (Metal) or Windows (DirectX). They cited better performance, lower memory overhead, and broader hardware compatibility (supporting older GPUs without DX12) as reasons to stick with native implementations on those platforms.\n*   **Performance Concerns:** Some contributors raised concerns regarding `wgpu`’s resource footprint, noting higher VRAM and host memory usage compared to specialized native renderers. There was also a brief debate regarding compilation times and the potential for a future web-based client, though maintainers noted that a web port would require significant work beyond the graphics layer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe transition is primarily a stability and maintenance move for the Linux platform. While it introduces some trade-offs in memory usage, it resolves long-standing rendering bugs and aligns Zed with the most robust, actively supported graphics library in the Rust ecosystem.",
    "chinese_title": "Zed 编辑器将图形库从 blade 切换为 wgpu",
    "chinese_summary": "该 GitHub 拉取请求（PR）记录了关于将 Zed 编辑器 Linux 版 UI 框架（GPUI）的图形库由 **blade** 替换为 **wgpu** 的提案及持续讨论。\n\n**主要动机：**\n提案者 *zortax* 指出，目前的 `blade` 库不稳定，给 Linux 用户造成了严重问题，特别是频繁导致 Nvidia 显卡和 Wayland 混成器卡死。通过切换到 Rust 图形生态系统的行业标准 `wgpu`，Zed 可以受益于社区（如 Bevy 游戏引擎）的共同改进，并确保更可靠的长期维护。此举的核心驱动力在于 `blade` 目前被认为处于无人维护状态，导致关键漏洞数月未获修复。\n\n**维护者与社区反馈：**\n*   **平台范围：** Zed 维护者对 Linux 平台的这一切换表示支持，但明确表示目前不打算替换 macOS（Metal）或 Windows（DirectX）的原生渲染器。他们认为原生实现具有更好的性能、更低的内存开销以及更广泛的硬件兼容性（支持不支持 DX12 的旧 GPU）。\n*   **性能担忧：** 一些贡献者对 `wgpu` 的资源占用表示担忧，指出其显存（VRAM）和主机内存使用量高于专门的原生渲染器。讨论中还涉及了编译时间以及未来开发 Web 客户端的可能性，但维护者指出，Web 端的移植除了图形层之外，仍需大量额外工作。\n\n**结论：**\n此次过渡主要是为了提升 Linux 平台的稳定性和可维护性。虽然在内存使用上存在一定的权衡，但它解决了长期存在的渲染漏洞，并使 Zed 与 Rust 生态中最为健壮且活跃维护的图形库保持了一致。"

    "summary": "In \"Open Source Is Not About You,\" Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, argues that open source is fundamentally a licensing and delivery mechanism, not a social contract. He challenges the \"recently-invented mythology\" of community-driven development, asserting that users are not entitled to a creator’s time, attention, or specific features.\n\nHickey emphasizes that project maintainers have the sole right to determine their project's direction and \"ought\" to work. Using Clojure as a case study, he reveals the personal and financial sacrifices made by the core team at Cognitect. Because the language provides no royalties and is funded through their own consulting earnings, Hickey views the software as a \"no-strings-attached gift.\" He defends Clojure’s conservative development process as a necessary safeguard against feature bloat and churn, noting that many community-submitted patches are ill-conceived or lack the rigor required for core integration.\n\nA central theme of the article is the \"morale erosion\" of creators caused by the pervasive sense of communal entitlement. Hickey argues that if users have needs that are not being met, it is their own responsibility to fulfill them by building their own tools or projects. He encourages those who wish to support the ecosystem to focus on positive contributions—such as documentation, libraries, and outreach—rather than demanding changes to the core language.\n\nUltimately, Hickey’s message is a firm defense of maintainer autonomy: creators owe the world the source code and the right to use it, but they do not owe the community their lives or a change in their personal focus.",

    "summary": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has entered a $225,000, one-year contract with Clearview AI to utilize its facial recognition technology for \"tactical targeting\" and \"strategic counter-network analysis.\" The tool, which relies on a database of over 60 billion images scraped from the internet without user consent, will be integrated into the daily operations of Border Patrol’s intelligence division and the National Targeting Center.\n\nThe deal marks a shift toward embedding biometric surveillance into routine intelligence infrastructure rather than reserving it for isolated investigations. However, the agreement lacks specific safeguards regarding the privacy of U.S. citizens, data retention periods, or the types of images agents are authorized to upload. This expansion has drawn sharp criticism from civil liberties groups and lawmakers. Senator Ed Markey recently introduced legislation to ban CBP and ICE from using facial recognition, citing concerns over a lack of transparency and public consent.\n\nTechnical limitations also present significant risks. Testing by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that while facial recognition is effective with high-quality photos, error rates exceed 20% for images captured in uncontrolled environments like border crossings. NIST warned that when the software is used to search for individuals not present in the database, the system will inevitably produce \"matches\" that are 100% incorrect, potentially leading to the wrongful targeting of innocent individuals during human reviews.",
