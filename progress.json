    "url": "https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/79371/this-telegram-must-be-closely-paraphrased-before-being-communicated-to-anyone",
    "summary": "The question explores why WWII-era telegrams often included the instruction to \"closely paraphrase\" the message before sharing it. The key reason was to prevent \"known-plaintext attacks\" on cryptographic systems.\n\nThe accepted answer explains that the US military doctrine at the time discouraged sending the exact same message twice using different encryption methods (or no encryption). Paraphrasing was the technique used to change the message and avoid this practice.\n\nAccording to a declassified US Army manual on cryptography, paraphrasing involved rewriting the message extensively while preserving its meaning. This included altering sentence structure, using synonyms, and avoiding repeated words or proper names. Deletion of wording was preferable to expansion.\n\nThe underlying danger was that if an adversary could compare an unencrypted version of a message with its encrypted counterpart, it could provide valuable information that would help them break the cipher. The allies knew this well, as the Germans used multiple encryptions, and capturing machines with easier to break ciphers allowed the allies to figure out messages from the stronger Enigma cipher. German procedural flaws and operator mistakes similarly allowed the Allies to break Enigma.\n\nTherefore, the instruction to \"closely paraphrase\" was a critical security measure designed to protect sensitive information by preventing the leakage of plaintext that could compromise cryptographic systems. \"Closely\" in this context meant both maintaining the original meaning and exercising care in the paraphrasing process.\n",
    "chinese_title": "此电报必须经过严密释义后方可传达。为什么？",
    "chinese_summary": "二战时期电报中“密切释义”指令的原因是为了防止密码系统遭受“已知明文攻击”。当时的美国军方理论不鼓励使用不同加密方法（或不加密）发送完全相同的消息两次。释义是改变消息并避免这种做法的手段。根据一份解密的美国陆军密码学手册，释义包括在保留消息含义的同时对其进行广泛改写，包括改变句子结构、使用同义词以及避免重复的词语或专有名词。删除措辞比扩展措辞更可取。潜在的危险在于，如果对手可以将消息的未加密版本与其加密版本进行比较，则可能提供有价值的信息，从而帮助他们破解密码。盟军深知这一点，因为德国人使用了多种加密方式，并且捕获具有更容易破解的密码的机器，使得盟军能够解开来自更强大的恩尼格玛密码的消息。德国的程序缺陷和操作员失误也同样使盟军得以破解恩尼格玛密码。因此，“密切释义”指令是一项关键的安全措施，旨在通过防止可能危及密码系统的明文泄露来保护敏感信息。“密切”在这种情况下既意味着保持原始含义，也意味着在释义过程中要谨慎。"

    "title": "Why haven't quantum computers factored 21 yet?",
    "url": "https://algassert.com/post/2500",
    "summary": "This article explains why quantum computers haven't factored 21, despite having factored 15 in 2001, challenging the claim that this lack of progress indicates stagnation in quantum computing. The key reason is the drastically increased complexity of the circuit required to factor 21 compared to 15. While the circuit to factor 15 has 21 entangling gates, the circuit for 21 requires a staggering 2405, over 100 times more complex.\n\nThis complexity arises because Shor's algorithm relies on conditional modular multiplications, which are significantly cheaper for 15 due to specific properties: many multiplications are by 1 (effectively free), the first multiplication is also nearly free, and the remaining multiplication can be implemented with simple circular shifts. These optimizations are not applicable when factoring 21.\n\nSpecifically, when factoring 21, there are no multiplications by 1, the first multiplication provides less proportional savings, and the remaining multiplications are far more computationally expensive, requiring significantly more Toffoli gates. These three factors contribute to the hundredfold increase in the circuit's cost.\n\nThe author also notes that the 2001 factoring of 15 was done with NMR computers, which have inherent scaling limitations. Additionally, quantum error correction, necessary for handling the increased gate count, adds further overhead. Finally, the author cautions against misleading \"quantum factoring\" results that rely on optimizations that effectively pre-determine the factors. He concludes that factoring small numbers like 21 isn't a good benchmark for measuring quantum computing progress and suggests focusing on advancements in quantum error correction and core scaling challenges.\n",
    "chinese_title": "为什么量子计算机还没能分解21？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文解释了为什么量子计算机尚未分解21，尽管它们在2001年已经分解了15，从而挑战了这种缺乏进展表明量子计算停滞不前的说法。 关键原因是分解21所需的电路复杂度比分解15的电路复杂度大幅增加。虽然分解15的电路有21个纠缠门，但分解21的电路需要惊人的2405个，复杂度超过100倍。\n\n这种复杂性产生的原因是Shor算法依赖于条件模乘，对于15来说，由于其特定的属性，条件模乘的成本要低得多：许多乘法是乘以1（实际上是免费的），第一次乘法也几乎是免费的，并且剩余的乘法可以用简单的循环移位来实现。 这些优化不适用于分解21的情况。\n\n具体而言，当分解21时，没有乘以1的乘法，第一次乘法提供的比例节省较少，并且剩余的乘法在计算上昂贵得多，需要更多的Toffoli门。 这三个因素导致了电路成本增加一百倍。\n\n作者还指出，2001年对15的分解是用核磁共振计算机完成的，该计算机具有固有的扩展限制。 此外，量子纠错对于处理增加的门数量是必需的，这增加了额外的开销。 最后，作者警告不要产生误导性的“量子分解”结果，这些结果依赖于有效预先确定因子的优化。 他总结说，分解像21这样的小数字并不是衡量量子计算进展的好基准，并建议关注量子纠错和核心扩展挑战方面的进展。"

    "url": "https://avi.im/blag/2025/db-cache/",
    "summary": "This article explores the idea of replacing caches with databases, arguing that while databases offer some advantages like simpler operations and the use of familiar SQL, caches still reign supreme due to their lower cost, efficiency in storing only frequently accessed data, and ability to handle high concurrency.\n\nThe author suggests using read replicas as a potential alternative to caches, leveraging in-memory data in database buffer pools and the non-strong consistency requirements of many caching scenarios. However, the article highlights several drawbacks: databases require more resources due to storing larger datasets, lack the fine-grained control over data prioritization found in caches, and have difficulty scaling to handle the connection demands of caches.\n\nThe author points towards the potential of Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) engines, like Noria and ReadySet, to pre-compute and cache complex query results within a database context. They also suggest leveraging partial read replicas and disaggregated storage to further reduce the resource overhead. The core problem is how to get a subset of data into a near-cache setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author believes that while advancements in IVM and database architectures are promising, a direct replacement of caches with databases is not currently feasible for all use cases. They envision a future where IVM and partial read replicas could bridge the gap, and possibly lead to IVM powering external cache services.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了用数据库取代缓存的想法，认为虽然数据库提供了一些优势，例如更简单的操作和使用熟悉的SQL，但由于缓存的成本更低、仅存储频繁访问数据的效率更高，以及能够处理高并发，因此缓存仍然占据主导地位。\n\n作者建议使用只读副本作为缓存的潜在替代方案，利用数据库缓冲池中的内存数据以及许多缓存场景的非强一致性要求。 然而，文章强调了几个缺点：数据库由于存储更大的数据集而需要更多的资源，缺乏缓存中存在的对数据优先级进行细粒度控制的能力，并且难以扩展以处理缓存的连接需求。\n\n作者指出了增量视图维护 (IVM) 引擎（如 Noria 和 ReadySet）的潜力，可以在数据库上下文中预先计算和缓存复杂的查询结果。他们还建议利用部分只读副本和分离式存储来进一步降低资源开销。 核心问题是如何将数据子集放入近缓存环境中。\n\n总而言之，作者认为，虽然 IVM 和数据库架构的进步前景广阔，但目前用数据库直接取代缓存对于所有用例来说并不可行。 他们设想未来 IVM 和部分只读副本可以弥合差距，并可能导致 IVM 为外部缓存服务提供动力。"

    "summary": "This article emphasizes **cognitive load** as the primary factor affecting code maintainability and developer productivity. It argues that reducing cognitive load should be the guiding principle behind software development practices, surpassing popular but often misused concepts like \"small functions\" or strict adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.\n\nThe article distinguishes between intrinsic (unavoidable task difficulty) and extraneous cognitive load (introduced by poor design choices). The focus is on minimizing extraneous load. It provides practical examples of how common coding practices, like complex conditionals, deeply nested inheritance, and excessive microservices, can increase cognitive burden.\n\nKey strategies for reducing cognitive load include:\n\n*   **Using descriptive variable names** to clarify complex logic.\n*   **Employing early returns** to simplify code flow and focus on the \"happy path.\"\n*   **Favoring composition over inheritance** to avoid complex class hierarchies.\n*   **Creating \"deep\" modules with simple interfaces** rather than numerous \"shallow\" modules that require understanding complex interactions.\n*   **Limiting language features** to reduce choices and complexity.\n*   **Using self-describing strings instead of numeric statuses** in APIs to avoid mental mapping.\n\nThe central message is that code should be written for readability and ease of understanding, prioritizing a developer's mental capacity to process information.

    "title": "A 20-Year-Old Algorithm Can Help Us Understand Transformer Embeddings",
    "url": "http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/db-ksvd/",
    "summary": "This article discusses using dictionary learning to understand the internal states of large language models (LLMs) by decomposing complex embeddings into interpretable concept vectors. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently gained popularity for this task, the authors advocate for revisiting the 20-year-old KSVD algorithm.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that, with modifications (double-batch KSVD or DB-KSVD) and an efficient implementation, KSVD can achieve comparable performance to SAEs on the SAEBench benchmark for language model interpretability, but with significantly faster processing times (reducing processing time from 30 days to 8 minutes). DB-KSVD uses alternating optimization to update concept vector assignments and the concept vectors themselves. The authors also provide an open-source Julia package, KSVD.jl, for easy implementation and integration with Python.\n\nBeyond the performance of DB-KSVD, the article explores the theoretical limits of dictionary learning, noting that the feasibility of recovering concept vectors depends on the size of the dataset and the dimensionality of the embeddings. The number of recoverable concept vectors is proportional to the square of the number of samples, while the number of recoverable concepts per sample is proportional to the square of the embedding dimension. The authors believe dictionary learning has potential applications in various domains beyond language, such as robotics and vision, given sufficient data and high-dimensional embeddings.\n",

    "summary": "This article details how to run the latest Vegas Pro 22 on Windows 7 x64, which is officially unsupported due to its end-of-life status. The author describes the process as a \"dirty-hack\" and outlines several mandatory steps.\n\nFirst, the user must update Windows 7 using the Simplix patcher, install .NET Framework 4.8.0 (not 4.8.1), update DirectX9, and install Visual C++ 2005-2022.  A DirectX12 compatibility layer is then installed by extracting specific DLL files (api-ms-win-core-version-l1-1-1.dll, d3d11on12.dll, d3d12.dll, dxilconv7.dll) to the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" folder.  The Simplix patcher may need to be run again to install additional updates.\n\nThe most critical part involves addressing the \"Createdxgifactory2 could not be located in the dynamic link library dxgi.dll\" error. The author recommends against replacing the system's DXGI.DLL globally due to potential system instability. Instead, they suggest using a local copy with Vegas 22.\n\nThe author finds success using DXGI.DLL extracted from older versions of Reshade (specifically v4.9.1, v5.2.0, or v6.4.0), renaming the extracted file RESHADE64.DLL to DXGI.DLL, and placing it in the same directory as the Vegas 22 executable. This provides the necessary graphical functions missing in the Windows 7 version of DXGI.DLL. The author also mentions the possibility of needing to rename it to D3D11.DLL instead.\n\nFinally, the article includes a script to kill Vegas Pro's residual processes after exiting the application to prevent memory leaks. The article notes that VxKex is not needed in this process.\n",

Enums are another welcome addition, providing a cleaner way to represent discrete values. Furthermore, the author praises Vlang's lambda expressions and array methods for enhanced code expressiveness.\n\nDespite these advantages, the author acknowledges Vlang's immaturity and potential challenges. They detail encountering issues with the `net.http` module requiring the `-d use_openssl` flag during compilation, as well as a perplexing import order dependency with the `veb` HTTP server. The article also touches on the increased complexity in Vlang's build process due to its C backend, requiring flags for performance optimization and cross-compilation.

    "url": "https://lafollette.wisc.edu/news/new-research-reveals-longevity-gains-slowing-life-expectancy-of-100-unlikely/",
    "summary": "New research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison's La Follette School of Public Affairs indicates that gains in human longevity are slowing down, making it unlikely that a life expectancy of 100 years will become common in the near future. The study, led by Professor Kristen Malecki and researcher Collin Strawhacker, analyzed trends in lifespan inequality, average lifespans, and the proportion of the population living to very old ages (85+) across several developed countries.\n\nTheir findings suggest that while average lifespans have increased significantly over the past century, the rate of increase has slowed considerably in recent decades. They also observed a plateauing of the number of people reaching extremely advanced ages, suggesting inherent biological limits to human lifespan. The research points to a \"ceiling\" on human longevity, which is likely influenced by factors such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and the limitations of medical advancements.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlights the importance of lifespan inequality – the disparity in how long people live. While average lifespans are a useful metric, they don't tell the whole story if some populations experience significantly shorter lives due to factors like poverty, lack of access to healthcare, or environmental hazards. Reducing lifespan inequality is therefore crucial for improving overall public health and well-being, even if a dramatic increase in average lifespan is unlikely. The research underscores the need to focus on improving health equity and addressing the underlying factors that contribute to disparities in longevity, rather than solely pursuing further increases in average lifespan.\n",

    "summary": "This article investigates the surprising behavior of `std::shared_ptr<T>` in GNU's libstdc++, specifically its reference counting mechanism. The author initially noticed that copying shared pointers in C++ was significantly faster than equivalent `Arc::clone` calls in Rust. Profiling revealed that libstdc++ employs a conditional atomic/non-atomic increment for the reference count.\n\nThe article delves into the implementation details, showing that `__gthread_active_p()` determines whether to use atomic or non-atomic operations. This function checks for the presence of the `pthread_key_create` symbol, inferring multi-threading usage from it. If the symbol isn't present, indicating a single-threaded context, non-atomic operations are used as an optimization.\n\nThe author questions the safety of this approach, exploring scenarios where parallelism might be achieved without `pthread`, such as through raw OS syscalls or dynamically linked libraries in statically compiled binaries.  While such cases are considered rare, they could lead to incorrect shared pointer behavior (dangling pointers, memory leaks).\n\nThe author compares the behavior of libstdc++ to libcxx (which allows disabling threads at compile time) and VisualC++ (which always uses atomic operations). Ultimately, the author concludes that while the libstdc++ optimization is generally safe in typical scenarios, uncommon environments might expose potential issues. The article serves as a cautionary tale about micro-benchmarking and the importance of understanding underlying library implementations. The author also highlights the Rust equivalent, `Arc`, which *always* uses atomic operations, offering stronger thread-safety guarantees.\n",

AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google are increasingly providing direct answers to user queries, reducing the need for users to click through to websites that originally created the content. This \"no-click\" environment diminishes the incentive for businesses to invest in high-quality content creation, as they receive less traffic and brand exposure.\n\nThe author highlights the symbiotic relationship that previously existed between Google, businesses, and the public: businesses created content to attract Google search traffic, Google provided relevant links, and the public gained access to information. However, Google's move towards AI-driven search results is disrupting this model, potentially leading to a content drought as businesses are disincentivized.\n\nThe article suggests that AI companies may be shortsighted, prioritizing rapid growth over the long-term sustainability of their content supply. While Google has historically relied on content creators, its current actions suggest it is unsure how to compete with ChatGPT without undermining the content ecosystem.\n\nThe author proposes potential solutions, including regulation to protect content creators from AI scraping. However, they acknowledge the challenges of implementing such measures quickly and effectively. They also speculate about a potential \"AI bubble\" bursting due to high infrastructure costs, but concede that AI's impact on search is likely irreversible.

The core idea is to extend Zellij's existing client/server architecture, where the server maintains terminal sessions in the background. The web client acts as another client, communicating with the server via a web server intermediary.\n\nThe architecture involves a single web server per machine handling multiple sessions. Sessions are uniquely identified by their URL, allowing users to bookmark them. Communication occurs over websockets, with separate channels for terminal data (STDOUT/STDIN) and control messages.\n\nSecurity is a key consideration. Users authenticate with a token generated within a Zellij session, hashed server-side, and exchanged for a temporary cookie. HTTPS is enforced for external interfaces.\n\nThe web server is built with Rust using the `axum` framework, leveraging its flexibility and integration with `tokio` for asynchronous operations. Static assets are included directly in the executable. Daemonization is handled with the `daemonize` crate, with error reporting via Unix pipes.\n\nThe client-side utilizes `xterm.js` for terminal emulation, with custom integrations for features like mouse AnyEvent tracking and window title updates. While TypeScript was considered, it was ultimately rejected due to the overhead of an additional build step.\n\nFuture plans include expanding the web interface with native UI components, blending multiple Zellij sessions, and potentially offering hosted solutions.\n",

    "summary": "Giant gullies are rapidly expanding in African cities, driven by a combination of natural factors like heavy rainfall and human factors such as inadequate drainage and urbanization. A study published in Nature found that nearly 3,000 urban gullies are present across 26 cities, stretching for hundreds of kilometers. These gullies are swallowing homes and businesses, displacing an average of 118,600 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone between 2004 and 2023, a figure that has doubled since 2020.\n\nResearchers estimate that hundreds of thousands more are at risk in the coming decade. The problem is exacerbated by the concentration of water along roads, which act as canals due to poor drainage systems. The study highlights the catastrophic and sometimes fatal consequences of gully expansion, particularly for vulnerable communities lacking alternative housing.\n\nThe authors emphasize the need for investment in preventative measures, as stabilizing existing gullies is significantly more expensive. They suggest prioritizing sustainable infrastructure, including effective drainage systems, and involving affected communities in planning interventions. With Africa's population expected to triple by 2050 and rainfall intensities projected to increase, urgent action is crucial to mitigate the growing threat of urban gully expansion.\n",

    "summary": "This article argues for the development of a standardized \"AI Model Virtual Machine\" (MVM) to improve the security, reliability, and interoperability of AI-powered applications. The authors, a group of researchers at Microsoft and the University of Washington, observe that current AI applications, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly complex, requiring robust control software to manage interactions between the model, external tools, and the user.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), they propose an MVM that acts as an intermediary layer between the AI model and the rest of the system. This MVM would define a set of instructions for tasks like loading models, calling tools, managing memory, and enforcing security policies.\n\nThe article highlights existing work like OpenAI's tool calling, Anthropic's MCP, and security-focused projects like FIDES and AC4A as precursors to the MVM concept. It then details the key benefits of a well-specified MVM, including separation of concerns, built-in safety and governance, transparent performance tracking, and verifiability of model output.  The authors emphasize that an MVM could enable a \"write once, run anywhere\" environment for AI models, promoting wider adoption and innovation.  They conclude by urging the community to engage in building a consensus around the need for such a specification and what it should include to improve AI systems' portability, interoperability, security, and reliability.\n",

    "summary": "This article previews Condor Computing's Cuzco RISC-V core, presented at Hot Chips 2025. Condor, a subsidiary of Andes Technology, aims to offer licensable RISC-V cores akin to Arm and SiFive. The Cuzco core is a high-performance, 8-wide out-of-order design targeting the same market segment as SiFive's P870 and Veyron's V1. It boasts a modern branch predictor and targets clock speeds of 2-2.5 GHz on TSMC's 5nm process.\n\nA key innovation is its \"time-based\" scheduling scheme, using a Time Resource Matrix (TRM) to predict instruction schedules in the rename/allocate stage, reducing the complexity and power consumption of the backend schedulers. This doesn't require any ISA modifications or special compiler treatment.\n\nCuzco is highly configurable, allowing customers to adjust the number of execution slices, L2 TLB size, bus widths, and L2/L3 cache capacity. Cores are arranged in clusters of up to eight, communicating via a CHI bus for scalability.\n\nThe frontend features a sophisticated TAGE-SC-L branch predictor and a two-level branch target buffer. The instruction fetch logic feeds from a 64KB instruction cache.\n\nThe backend utilizes the pre-calculated schedules from the renamer, simplifying out-of-order execution. Instruction replay handles variable latency instructions like cache misses. Execution resources are grouped into slices with dedicated execution queues (XEQs). The core supports 256/512-bit VLENs and offers 8 FMA operations per cycle. The load/store unit has dedicated queues and a physically indexed, physically addressed L1 data cache. The L3 cache is split into slices to match core count.\n\nThe article concludes that Cuzco attempts to innovate within the established out-of-order execution model, offering a potentially efficient approach while maintaining RISC-V compatibility.\n",

    "summary": "This arXiv preprint, submitted on August 25, 2025, by Jakob Steininger and Sergey Yurkevich, addresses a problem in metric geometry related to Rupert's property. A three-dimensional convex body possesses Rupert's property if a congruent copy of itself can pass through a straight hole bored through it. The paper presents a construction of a convex polyhedron that demonstrably *lacks* Rupert's property, thereby disproving a conjecture dating back to 2017. In addition, the authors identify a polyhedron that *is* Rupert, but *not* locally Rupert. The article is categorized under Metric Geometry, Computational Geometry, and Combinatorics and utilizes MSC classes 51-08 and 51-04. The submission includes links to the PDF and experimental HTML versions of the paper, as well as the TeX source code.

This marked the first time a pig lung had been transplanted into a human, representing a significant advancement in xenotransplantation.\n\nThe pig lung, sourced from a six-gene-edited Bama miniature pig, functioned for nine days within the recipient. The experiment aimed to observe the patient's immune response to the foreign organ, rather than achieving a long-term solution. While immediate hyperacute rejection was avoided, the patient displayed increasing signs of organ rejection, including severe swelling and antibody-mediated damage leading to primary graft dysfunction. The experiment was eventually terminated.\n\nThe article emphasizes the complexity of lung transplantation due to the organ's direct exposure to the external environment and its role as a first line of defense against pathogens. Despite the challenges, the researchers demonstrated that a pig lung can be transplanted into a human without immediate hyperacute rejection.\n\nThe researchers highlight the need for continued research to optimize immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, improve lung preservation strategies, and assess long-term graft function. They conclude that this study provides crucial insights into the barriers that must be overcome to move closer to clinical application of lung xenotransplantation.\n",

    "url": "https://www.philipzucker.com/compose_datalog/",
    "summary": "This article explores a novel approach to implementing Datalog using SQL, focusing on representing Datalog environments (variable bindings) as relations within SQL. Instead of directly manipulating Datalog relations (like `edge` or `path`), the author manipulates the environments resulting from Datalog body expressions using SQL's relational algebra.\n\nThe core idea is that Datalog bodies, SQL's SELECT-FROM-WHERE structure, and relational algebra expressions are all different ways of expressing conjunctive queries. The author demonstrates a Python-based combinator implementation that converts base Datalog relations into environment relations. These relations are then joined via inner joins, which SQL excels at.\n\nThe article introduces `RelDecl` and `EnvRel` classes to represent relations and environments in SQL. `RelDecl` is used to define a relation (like `edge/2`), and `EnvRel` represents the environment (set of variable bindings) resulting from a query. Overloaded operators (`&` for conjunction, `<=` for rule definition) allow for expressing Datalog rules in a more natural syntax that generates SQL queries.\n\nThe author shows how to implement fixpoint computations (running rules until nothing new is produced) using naive evaluation in SQL. As a bonus, the article explores semi-naive evaluation using the concept of \"dual numbers\" from automatic differentiation, effectively tracking both the primary and delta relations within SQL. This method allows for more efficient fixpoint computations by only considering new facts in each iteration.

    "summary": "This article from Saving Country Music highlights the frustrating issue of music copyright strikes against podcasts and YouTube creators, specifically focusing on Rick Beato's recent rant on the subject. The author argues that current copyright enforcement is overly punitive, disproportionately affecting podcasts that feature even brief music clips for discussion or educational purposes.\n\nThe article points out the hypocrisy of the system, where visual content like films can be shared with fewer repercussions, while music podcasts face account deletion for minor infringements. The author emphasizes that these draconian measures prevent podcasters from promoting music and artists, creating a lose/lose situation.\n\nRick Beato's frustration, particularly with Universal Music Group's aggressive copyright claims, is central to the piece. Beato argues that using music clips to discuss artists' work clearly falls under fair use and that labels are harming their own artists by suppressing content that promotes them.\n\nSaving Country Music has been advocating for change for over 15 years, but with little progress. The article argues that the music industry is missing a major opportunity to leverage podcasts for promotion, especially as the platform gains popularity. The industry needs to create a system that allows podcasters to use music fairly and compensates artists appropriately, as well as providing creators with viable recourse to dispute claims. The author concludes with the hope that Beato's higher profile will finally spark meaningful change.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the use of cheaper lasers, specifically Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs), for short-distance optical communication, particularly within data centers. While optical technology is well-established for long-haul communication, the focus is shifting towards shorter distances to replace copper wires with fiber for faster and more efficient data transfer.\n\nThe article highlights the challenges of integrating lasers with silicon, including reliability, temperature sensitivity, and energy consumption. Distributed Feedback lasers (DFBs) are currently used but are more expensive than VCSELs.\n\nVCSELs, commonly found in applications like optical mice, offer advantages like ease of manufacturing and lower cost, but they also have limitations like non-standard wavelengths, wider bandwidth, and lower power, making them less suitable for silicon photonics applications. However, for simple interconnects, these limitations might not matter.\n\nThe article discusses efforts to improve VCSELs, including developing longer wavelengths and addressing issues with modes and polarization. Companies like Volantis Semiconductor are engineering improved VCSELs for optical interposers, emphasizing improved temperature tolerance and power efficiency.\n\nThe conclusion suggests that while VCSELs have historically been less favored due to certain characteristics, recent advancements and modifications may make them a viable and cost-effective option for short-distance optical interconnects within data centers, potentially serving in non-photonic applications.\n",

    "summary": "This article presents a spectral engineering and thermal management strategy to significantly enhance the performance of solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs). The researchers achieved a 15-fold increase in STEG power generation with only a 25% increase in weight by optimizing both the hot and cold sides of the generator.\n\nAt the hot side, a regular tungsten (W) surface is transformed into a selective solar absorber (W-SSA) using femtosecond (fs)-laser processing. This technique enhances solar absorption (over 80% efficiency) while minimizing infrared emissivity. A greenhouse chamber is also designed to further reduce convective heat loss from the W-SSA.\n\nOn the cold side, the fs-laser processing is used to convert regular aluminum (Al) into a micro-structured heat dissipator (μ-dissipator), which doubles the cooling performance compared to a regular Al heat sink. This is achieved through enhanced radiative and convective heat dissipation.\n\nThe combined spectral engineering and thermal management strategies increase the temperature difference (ΔT) across the STEG, leading to a substantial boost in output power. The fs-laser processing is highlighted as a scalable and environmentally friendly technique compared to traditional methods. The optimized W-SSA demonstrates good spectral selectivity and temperature stability, making it a suitable absorber material. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Potential applications for the high-efficiency STEG include wireless sensor networks, wearable electronics, and medical sensors.\n",

    "summary": "This article challenges the \"heat death\" hypothesis, which posits that the universe will inevitably become increasingly disordered and lifeless due to the second law of thermodynamics. It highlights emerging interpretations suggesting this may not be the case.\n\nThe heat death hypothesis states that entropy (disorder) increases in a closed system, leading to the eventual dissipation of all usable energy and the end of complexity, organization, and life itself. However, the article argues that the universe, being an expanding system, may not be subject to the same constraints as closed systems used to derive the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nSeveral prominent scientists, including Seth Lloyd, Eric Chaisson, Freeman Dyson, Stuart Kauffman, Christof Koch, and Ray Kurzweil, are mentioned as proponents of the idea that the universe is becoming more complex and organized over time, potentially with life playing a crucial role. Julian Barbour, in his book \"The Janus Point,\" argues that the second law, as popularly interpreted, doesn't apply to the expanding universe, suggesting order can increase indefinitely. David Deutsch goes even further, stating there are no fundamental limits to knowledge creation, implying life's potential for continuous existence.\n\nThe article delves into the history of thermodynamics, distinguishing between classical and statistical interpretations of the second law. The classical view focused on the dissipation of energy, while the statistical view, popularized by Ludwig Boltzmann, focused on increasing disorder at the molecular level. Boltzmann's application of the second law to the entire universe, envisioning it as a closed system tending towards disorder, led to the heat death scenario.\n\nHowever, the article implies that if the universe is not a closed system, the continuous growth of complexity and order is possible, challenging the doomsday predictions associated with the heat death hypothesis. The article concludes that intelligent life can increase organization as long as it finds free energy.\n",

Some users report success using it on Xfce, while others, particularly on lower DPI displays, find it too wide. The conversation also touches on Nokia's past software support issues and comparisons to other Linux UI experiences.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了作者的发现，即诺基亚Sans字体（2002年至2013年诺基亚设备上使用的标志性字体）作为通用用户界面(UI)字体，效果出人意料地好。作者Thom Holwerda出于怀旧，在网上找到各个变体后，决定尝试使用诺基亚Sans。\n\n他推荐使用“Wide”变体，呼应了该字体的创造者Erik Spiekermann的观点，Spiekermann不同意诺基亚放弃它的决定，声称它不能作为UI字体使用。Spiekermann批评替代字体平淡无奇，浪费了品牌认知度。\n\nHolwerda发现诺基亚Sans具有高度可读性和个性，取代Inter成为他首选的UI字体。他承认这是一种个人偏好，并鼓励读者自己尝试。他指出他的经验是在高DPI显示器和Wayland上的KDE环境下，在Windows或macOS等其他系统，或者在较低DPI显示器上，结果可能有所不同。\n\n评论区揭示了其他人使用该字体的体验，特别是其与N900等诺基亚设备的怀旧联系。一些用户报告在Xfce上成功使用它，而另一些用户，特别是在较低DPI显示器上，认为它太宽了。对话还涉及诺基亚过去在软件支持方面的问题，以及与其他Linux UI体验的比较。"

    "url": "https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/hurricanes/now-is-the-time-hurricane-category-6-could-be-introduced-under-new-storm-severity-scale",
    "summary": "This article discusses a proposed new hurricane categorization system, the Tropical Cyclone Severity Scale (TCSS), designed to improve public awareness of hurricane dangers beyond wind speed. The current Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS) relies solely on wind speed, failing to account for the significant risks posed by storm surges and rainfall, which are responsible for approximately 80% of hurricane-related deaths.\n\nExamples like Hurricane Katrina (Category 3) and Hurricane Florence (Category 1) demonstrate how the SSHWS can underestimate the severity of a storm, leading to inadequate preparation and tragic consequences. The TCSS aims to address these shortcomings by incorporating wind speed, storm surge, and rainfall into a six-category scale. It assigns scores to each hazard and combines them using specific rules to determine a final category.\n\nA study testing the TCSS showed that participants receiving TCSS forecasts were better able to identify the main hazards and were more likely to evacuate for non-wind related dangers compared to those who received SSHWS forecasts. Researchers believe that adopting the TCSS would improve public understanding of hurricane risks and promote more informed decision-making, ultimately leading to better preparedness and reduced loss of life.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了一种拟议的新飓风分级系统——热带气旋强度等级（TCSS），旨在提高公众对飓风危险的认识，使其超越风速。目前的萨菲尔-辛普森飓风等级（SSHWS）仅依赖于风速，未能考虑到风暴潮和降雨带来的重大风险，而风暴潮和降雨约占飓风相关死亡人数的 80%。\n\n卡特里娜飓风（3 级）和弗洛伦斯飓风（1 级）等案例表明，SSHWS可能会低估风暴的严重程度，导致准备不足和悲惨后果。TCSS 旨在通过将风速、风暴潮和降雨纳入六个等级的量表来解决这些缺点。它为每种危害分配分数，并使用特定规则将它们组合起来以确定最终等级。\n\n一项测试 TCSS 的研究表明，与收到 SSHWS 预报的参与者相比，收到 TCSS 预报的参与者能够更好地识别主要危害，并且更有可能因非风力相关危险而撤离。研究人员认为，采用 TCSS 将提高公众对飓风风险的理解，并促进更明智的决策，最终带来更好的准备和更少的生命损失。"

    "summary": "This article argues that deleting tests, a practice often considered taboo, is sometimes necessary and beneficial for software development. The core purpose of tests is to provide confidence that changes won't break existing functionality. However, when tests become unreliable or hinder the development process, they undermine this confidence.\n\nThe author identifies several scenarios where deleting tests is advisable:\n\n*   **Flaky tests:** Randomly failing tests erode trust and cause developers to ignore genuine failures. The cost of maintaining flaky tests outweighs the potential benefit of catching future bugs.\n*   **Overly coupled tests:** Tests that require extensive modification for minor code changes reduce efficiency and don't significantly increase confidence.\n*   **Slow tests:** Test suites that take too long to run lead to skipping tests, creating a false sense of security and potentially masking bugs.\n*   **Obsolete tests:** Tests that reflect outdated business requirements waste time and resources if updated. It's better to focus on testing the new behavior directly.\n\nIn essence, the article advocates for a pragmatic approach to testing, prioritizing quality and relevance over quantity. Deleting tests that are no longer effective or efficient can improve developer productivity and maintain confidence in the codebase.\n",
