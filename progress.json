This ensures that the same skill can function consistently regardless of the specific agent tool being used. \n\nOriginally developed by **Anthropic**, Agent Skills has been released as an open standard. It is currently supported by leading AI development tools and is open to community contributions. Developers and organizations can get started by utilizing the **SKILL.md** specification and reference libraries available on GitHub.",

    "summary": "Deno has launched **Deno Sandbox**, a secure execution environment designed to address the unique risks of running LLM-generated code. Available in beta, the service provides lightweight Linux microVMs that boot in under a second, offering a \"defense-in-depth\" approach to running untrusted scripts that require network access and API credentials.\n\nA core innovation is the sandbox’s **secret management system**. Instead of exposing real API keys to the environment, code sees only a placeholder. The actual credentials materialize only when the sandbox makes an outbound request to a pre-approved host, effectively preventing prompt-injected code from exfiltrating sensitive keys. Complementing this is **network egress control**, which allows developers to restrict VM-level communication to specific domains.\n\nKey features and technical details include:\n*   **Developer Experience:** Sandboxes can be managed via JavaScript or Python SDKs and support interaction through SSH, HTTP, or direct VS Code integration.\n*   **Seamless Deployment:** The `sandbox.deploy()` function allows users to transition code directly from a sandbox to a production-ready, auto-scaling serverless environment on Deno Deploy without rebuilding.\n*   **Persistence:** Support for read-write **Volumes** and read-only **Snapshots** enables pre-installed toolchains and persistent state.\n*   **Specifications:** Instances offer 2 vCPUs and up to 4GB of RAM, with a maximum lifetime of 30 minutes.\n\nDeno Sandbox is included in Deno Deploy plans with usage-based pricing ($0.05/h CPU time and $0.016/GB-h memory). It is optimized for AI agents, secure plugin systems, and ephemeral CI runners. The announcement coincides with the general availability of Deno Deploy.",

    "url": "https://github.com/j178/prek",
    "summary": "**Prek** is a high-performance, Rust-engineered replacement for the popular `pre-commit` framework. Designed as a faster, dependency-free, \"drop-in\" alternative, it eliminates the need for a Python runtime by providing a single standalone binary. Despite being a relatively new tool, it has already gained significant industry adoption, powering major projects such as CPython, Apache Airflow, FastAPI, and Ruff.\n\nKey advantages of Prek include:\n\n*   **Performance and Efficiency:** Prek is significantly faster than the original tool, utilizing parallel cloning and hook execution. It reduces disk footprint by sharing toolchains and dependencies across hooks rather than duplicating them.\n*   **Enhanced Functionality:** It introduces built-in monorepo (workspace) support, native Rust implementations of common hooks, and seamless integration with `uv` for lightning-fast Python environment management.\n*   **Improved User Experience:** The CLI offers advanced features like running hooks on specific directories, filtering by the last commit, and shell completions. It also includes a `prek list` command for better configuration visibility and a `self update` feature.\n\nWhile Prek aims for full compatibility with existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files, some language-specific features are still reaching parity. Installation is highly flexible, supporting nearly every major package manager—including Homebrew, PyPI, npm, Nix, Conda, and Cargo—as well as standalone scripts for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Heavily inspired by the original `pre-commit` and Astral’s `uv`, Prek represents a modern, optimized evolution of the pre-commit workflow.",

    "url": "https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2026/02/02/whats-up-with-all-those-equals-signs-anyway/",
    "summary": "This article explains that the abundance of equals signs (`=`) found in recently surfaced excerpts of old emails is neither a secret code nor an OCR error. Instead, it is a technical artifact of **Quoted-Printable** encoding, a method used to ensure emails could pass through older mail servers that struggled with long lines or special characters.\n\nThe author highlights two primary reasons these equals signs appear in the text:\n\n1.  **Soft Line Breaks:** To prevent delivery errors, email software would break long lines of text by inserting an equals sign followed by a carriage return and a line feed (CRLF). A proper email reader is supposed to strip these characters to reconstruct the original line. However, the author argues that these specific emails were likely converted from Windows-style line endings (CRLF) to Unix-style endings (NL) before being decoded. This caused the decoding algorithms to fail, leaving the equals signs behind.\n2.  **Special Character Encoding:** The equals sign is also used to encode non-ASCII characters, such as non-breaking spaces (e.g., `=C2=A0`). In the leaked emails, these appear because the data was processed using improper tools—likely simple search-and-replace methods—rather than a dedicated email decoder.\n\nUltimately, the author concludes that the \"messy\" appearance of these emails is the result of a \"garbage in, garbage out\" scenario. The individuals who processed and converted these archives were likely incompetent, using buggy or inappropriate algorithms that failed to account for the technical nuances of legacy email standards.",
    "chinese_title": "那些等号到底是怎么回事？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文解释道，最近曝光的旧邮件摘要中出现的大量等号（=）既不是秘密代码，也不是 OCR 错误。相反，它是 Quoted-Printable 编码产生的技术痕迹，这种编码方法旨在确保邮件能顺利通过那些难以处理长行或特殊字符的旧式邮件服务器。\n\n作者强调了文中出现这些等号的两个主要原因：\n\n1.  **软换行（Soft Line Breaks）：** 为了防止传输错误，邮件软件会通过插入一个等号，后接回车符和换行符（CRLF）来折断长文本行。合格的邮件阅读器应当去除这些字符以还原原始行。然而，作者认为这些特定的邮件在解码前，很可能已从 Windows 风格的换行符（CRLF）被转换成了 Unix 风格（NL）。这导致解码算法失效，从而留下了等号。\n2.  **特殊字符编码：** 等号还用于对非 ASCII 字符进行编码，例如不换行空格（如 `=C2=A0`）。在泄露的邮件中出现这些符号，是因为处理数据时使用了不当工具——很可能是简单的搜索替换方法——而非专业的邮件解码器。\n\n最终，作者得出结论，这些邮件之所以显得“凌乱”，是“垃圾进，垃圾出（garbage in, garbage out）”的结果。处理和转换这些存档的人员可能极不专业，使用了带有漏洞或不恰当的算法，未能考虑到传统邮件标准的技术细节。"

Driven by security concerns and geopolitical tensions, nations like France, Germany, and Austria are moving to reduce their reliance on U.S. providers like Microsoft, Zoom, and Google.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n*   **France:** The government announced that 2.5 million civil servants will transition from U.S. video conferencing tools (Zoom, Teams, Webex) to a domestic platform called \"Visio\" by 2027 to ensure data confidentiality.\n*   **Regional Shifts:** The Austrian military and the German state of Schleswig-Holstein have adopted open-source software like LibreOffice and Nextcloud. Denmark and various Italian cities are also exploring similar \"vendor-independent\" solutions.\n\n**Driving Factors:**\n*   **Geopolitical Vulnerability:** The Trump administration’s \"belligerent\" posture has fueled fears that U.S. tech could be used as a political lever. A pivotal moment occurred when Microsoft disconnected the International Criminal Court prosecutor’s email following U.S. sanctions, sparking fears of a \"kill switch\" for critical infrastructure.\n*   **Data Privacy:** Ongoing concerns regarding U.S. surveillance and the vulnerability of cloud-hosted data have made European-controlled \"sovereign clouds\" a priority.\n*   **Strategic Autonomy:** European leaders argue that reliance on a few foreign entities—including Elon Musk’s Starlink—poses a risk to the continent’s ability to act independently.\n\nWhile U.S. companies like Microsoft emphasize their commitment to European data residency and local partnerships, the \"zeitgeist\" in Europe has shifted. Once motivated primarily by cost-saving, the move toward open-source and domestic software is now viewed as a strategic necessity to prevent foreign coercion and protect sensitive innovations.",
