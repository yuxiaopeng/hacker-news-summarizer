    "summary": "The article discusses the author's potential discovery of Gemini 3.0 being tested through A/B testing on Google AI Studio. Fueled by rumors and SVG images circulating, the author attempted to generate an SVG of an Xbox 360 controller, a task previously shown to be a good proxy for gauging model quality. After several tries, the author encountered the A/B test and received an SVG image of the controller that appeared significantly better than outputs from previous models.\n\nThe model ID associated with this potential Gemini 3.0 instance was \"ecpt50a2y6mpgkcn.\" The author speculates that the A/B test was likely comparing Gemini 3.0 Pro against Gemini 2.5 Pro, given the user's selection of Gemini 2.5 Pro. Notably, \"Gemini 3.0\" had a 24-second longer time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 40% longer output length, suggesting it isn't a lightweight, fast model. The author concludes that this observation provides tentative evidence of Gemini 3.0 being tested, with a focus on improved SVG generation capabilities, potentially reflecting overall coding performance enhancements.\n",

    "summary": "This article introduces LACE (Link Automata Computing Engine), a new platform for exploring cellular automata where the connections (links) between cells play a crucial role. Unlike traditional cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life, LACE rules consider both the states of cells and the topology of their connections in determining the next state.\n\nThe author, inspired by digital physics and the limitations of conventional cellular automata in capturing the dynamic nature of spacetime, developed LACE over decades. The core idea is that the relationships between elements (cells) are as important as the elements themselves.\n\nLACE allows for rules that incorporate topological properties like the number of connections or neighbor degree. This enables more complex and interesting behaviors, leading to the emergence of new stable patterns, oscillators, and gliders. The \"Realm of LACE\" rules, which fully utilize the topological capabilities, demonstrate behaviors resembling \"artificial life.\"\n\nThe article provides examples, including link-aware variants of the Game of Life and novel LACE rules like \"Amazing Dragons,\" showcasing the impact of links on the system's evolution. The author encourages readers to explore the provided Python code repository, experiment with different rules, and share their findings. LACE also offers a GPU-accelerated mode for large-scale simulations. Essentially, LACE opens up a new computational vista by incorporating the dynamic evolution of topology into cellular automata.\n",

    "title": "Ld_preload, the Invisible Key Theft",
    "url": "https://bomfather.dev/blog/ld-preload-the-invisible-key-theft/",
    "summary": "This article details how the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable and `/etc/ld.so.preload` file can be exploited to steal private keys from applications, specifically focusing on Solana validators as an example. The attack leverages a malicious shared library that intercepts the `close()` system call. When an application closes a file, the library checks if the file path contains \"solana-run\" (indicating a keypair file) and, if so, copies the file to an exfiltration directory before allowing the original `close()` function to complete.\n\nThe key is hooking into `close()` to examine the file being closed via `/proc/self/fd/{fd}`. This allows targeted theft of keys without affecting the application's functionality or raising immediate alarms. The attack can be deployed either through the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable or by modifying `/etc/ld.so.preload`. The environment variable method doesn't require root privileges for a user's own processes, making it particularly dangerous. The `/etc/ld.so.preload` method requires root access to modify, but affects all processes on the system or within a container.\n\nThe article emphasizes that containers do not inherently protect against this type of attack, as the environment variable and file modifications occur within the container's namespace. The author highlights the simplicity and stealth of the attack, noting that it leverages legitimate debugging features and expected file access patterns, potentially bypassing standard security measures like EDR agents. The code and demo of the attack are available on GitHub for educational and security testing purposes.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文详细介绍了如何利用 `LD_PRELOAD` 环境变量和 `/etc/ld.so.preload` 文件来窃取应用程序的私钥，并以 Solana 验证器为例进行了重点说明。该攻击利用一个恶意共享库来拦截 `close()` 系统调用。当应用程序关闭文件时，该库会检查文件路径是否包含 \"solana-run\"（表明是密钥对文件），如果是，则将该文件复制到一个外泄目录，然后再允许原始的 `close()` 函数完成。\n\n关键在于挂钩 `close()` 函数，并通过 `/proc/self/fd/{fd}` 检查正在关闭的文件。这允许有针对性地窃取密钥，而不会影响应用程序的功能或立即发出警报。该攻击可以通过 `LD_PRELOAD` 环境变量或修改 `/etc/ld.so.preload` 来部署。环境变量方法不需要用户自身进程的 root 权限，因此特别危险。`/etc/ld.so.preload` 方法需要 root 权限才能修改，但会影响系统上或容器内的所有进程。\n\n文章强调，容器本身并不能防止此类攻击，因为环境变量和文件修改发生在容器的命名空间内。作者强调了攻击的简单性和隐蔽性，指出它利用了合法的调试功能和预期的文件访问模式，可能绕过诸如 EDR 代理之类的标准安全措施。该攻击的代码和演示可在 GitHub 上获得，用于教育和安全测试目的。"

    "summary": "This is a very limited amount of information. Based on the title \"A stateful browser agent using self-healing DOM maps\" and the tagline \"100X.Bot | 100x All-in-One AI Agent Platform,\" we can infer the following:\n\nThe article likely discusses a browser agent powered by AI and marketed by 100X.Bot. The core innovation seems to be a \"stateful\" agent, meaning it remembers and utilizes past interactions and data within a browsing session. This contrasts with stateless agents that treat each interaction as isolated.\n\nA key component of this agent is the use of \"self-healing DOM maps.\" DOM (Document Object Model) maps represent the structure of a webpage. \"Self-healing\" implies that the agent can automatically adapt to changes in the webpage's structure, even when the HTML or CSS is modified. This robustness is crucial for reliable automation, as websites frequently update their layouts.\n\nTherefore, the agent aims to provide robust and persistent browser automation by:\n\n*   **Maintaining state:** Remembering past interactions.\n*   **Using self-healing DOM maps:** Adapting to changes in webpage structure.\n*   **Being part of the 100X.Bot platform:** Implies it's commercially available or part of a larger suite of AI automation tools.\n\nThe \"100x All-in-One AI Agent Platform\" suggests this agent is part of a wider offering including various AI-powered agents designed for automation and productivity. It aims to drastically increase (100x) efficiency in some domain, likely related to web-based tasks.\n",

    "url": "https://lwn.net/Articles/1039073/",
    "summary": "This LWN.net article from October 2025 discusses upcoming Rust language features crucial for Linux kernel development, driven by the \"Rust for Linux\" project. Tyler Mandry emphasizes that the project has focused volunteer efforts on specific needs, accelerating feature development.\n\nThe article highlights three key areas: field projections, arbitrary self types, and in-place initialization. Field projections aim to generalize pointer manipulation, allowing custom smart pointers (essential for kernel tasks like handling untrusted data) to access structure fields efficiently, mimicking C's behavior and enabling features like RCU protection within mutexes.\n\nArbitrary self types focus on improving ergonomics with smart pointers. They allow methods to accept smart pointers directly (like `Pin<&mut MyStruct>`), simplifying code and reducing dereferencing complexity. A new `Receiver` trait is proposed to control which types support this feature, preventing backward compatibility issues.\n\nIn-place initialization aims to simplify the creation of structures fixed in memory (using `Pin`). Three approaches are considered: a new `init` keyword to automatically implement the `PinInit` trait, a new `&out` reference type for write-only initialization, and guaranteed copy elision optimization. The Rust developers will likely evaluate each approach.\n\nThe article notes the features' early stages, but their potential to simplify smart pointer usage inside and outside the kernel and the impact of the Rust for Linux project driving overall Rust language improvements.\n",

These C-suite executives are responsible for building and maintaining stakeholder trust, particularly concerning data handling and security. The role emerged in response to concerns about potential misuse of technology and data.\n\nAccording to Forrester VP Jeff Pollard, CTrOs offer assurance to customers that their data and the company's infrastructure are trustworthy. Hiring a CTrO elevates trust to an executive priority, influencing company-wide practices and focusing efforts effectively.\n\nHowever, Pollard warns that isolating the CTrO from the technical side of the business can lead to a loss of insight. Chris Peake, CTrO at Gong, explains that his role combines IT and security, impacting revenue, negotiations, and customer onboarding. He believes the role is a natural evolution for CISOs, adding a \"business level\" perspective.\n\nForrester argues that the CTrO role isn't just a fad, emphasizing that the need for someone to oversee trust will remain.

As a solo developer, he sought a monolithic solution to avoid managing separate frontend and backend stacks, which would be necessary with options like React/Next.js with Laravel.\n\nWhile appreciating the simplicity of Rails Hotwire and Laravel Livewire in reducing JavaScript dependency, Akarsh needed seamless background jobs, real-time updates, and two-way communication. Phoenix LiveView stood out due to its performance, built-in background jobs (Oban), familiar syntax, and superior LiveView implementation.\n\nLiveView's WebSocket communication allows real-time updates without constant requests, offering a balance between server-rendered and frontend-heavy approaches. Integration with JavaScript libraries via hooks is also possible. Elixir's foundation on Erlang ensures high concurrency and fault tolerance, crucial for reliable applications.\n\nAkarsh highlighted benefits like faster development, high concurrency handling, single-language coding, readable code, compiler-based bug catching, and fault tolerance. He emphasizes that the choice was specific to his project, Hyperzoned.com, and encourages exploration of different technologies to find the best fit for specific needs, advocating for continuous learning.\n",

    "url": "https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/mc2-how-electricity-can-heal-wounds-three-times-as-fast/",
    "summary": "Researchers at Chalmers and the University of Freiburg have developed a method using electrical stimulation to accelerate wound healing, potentially revolutionizing treatment for individuals with impaired healing abilities such as those with diabetes or spinal injuries. The study found that electrically stimulating wounds on artificial skin led to healing three times faster compared to unstimulated wounds.\n\nThe principle behind the method lies in the electrotactic nature of skin cells, meaning they migrate directionally in electric fields. By applying a low-intensity electric field (200 mV/mm) via a biochip, researchers were able to guide cell movement and significantly speed up the healing process. Notably, the method also showed promise in mitigating the effects of diabetes on wound healing, where the electrical stimulation restored healing rates in affected cells to levels close to healthy skin cells.\n\nThe research team is now focused on refining the method to develop personalized wound healing treatments. They aim to create a system that can scan wounds and adjust the electrical stimulation accordingly. With recent funding, they plan to further investigate cell interactions during stimulation and eventually develop commercially available wound healing products. The study highlights the potential of bioelectronic microfluidic systems in addressing chronic wound issues and improving the quality of life for individuals with compromised healing capabilities.\n",

    "summary": "This article introduces Web Application Integrity, Consistency, and Transparency (WAICT), a proposed system aiming to improve the trustworthiness of JavaScript on the web by addressing the security vulnerabilities inherent in code distribution. The central problem is that malicious actors can easily modify JavaScript in web applications, especially those relying on in-browser cryptography.\n\nWAICT aims to provide integrity, consistency, and transparency to web applications, similar to what app stores offer for mobile apps, but without requiring a centralized authority. It defines a web application as a collection of interlinked assets (HTML, JavaScript, WASM, CSS) and uses Subresource Integrity (SRI) and an integrity manifest to commit to specific versions of these assets.\n\nThe core concept is to create a publicly auditable log of a website's code using hash chains. Each site maintains its own log, containing historical versions of its integrity manifest. A \"witness,\" a trusted third party, verifies the consistency of the log and signs the new chain hash.\n\nTo signal transparency enrollment and prevent undetectable disabling, a global prefix tree maps site domains to their log chain hashes. Witnesses then verify whole-tree updates, ensuring that site logs are append-only.\n\nThe client-side verification process involves verifying inclusion proofs for the site's manifest in its log and the log's membership in the global prefix tree, along with verifying witness signatures over the prefix tree root. This ensures that the website's code is both verifiable and auditable, enhancing security. The article also outlines important requirements for such a system, including non-interference with existing sites, opt-in participation, user privacy, and ease of use.\n",

They suggest the Cameraheads embody fears of becoming overly merged with media technology, especially surveillance tools, blurring the lines between the organic and the artificial. This resonates with Deuze's concept of \"media life,\" where we are constantly archived and intervened upon, making the Cameraheads a monstrous avatar for our anxieties about being perpetually recorded.\n\nFurthermore, the article argues that *Skibidi Toilet*'s dystopian setting, filled with concrete office blocks, reflects concerns about the corporate annihilation of the natural world fueled by surveillance capitalism. The ambivalence of the Cameraheads, acting as both saviors and threats, mirrors the double-edged sword of surveillance technology, which is used for both security and control.

These insects, including the marmalade hoverfly, were observed resting on the rigs before taking off again, often in large numbers. Analysis of pollen found on these flies revealed they were carrying it from distances up to 500km away, demonstrating long-distance pollen transport by hoverflies.\n\nThe study highlights that hoverflies, crucial pollinators, undertake significant seasonal migrations, moving between southern Spain and as far north as Norway. This journey is fueled by carbohydrates and body fat. The pollen carried by the hoverflies originated from a diverse array of over 100 plant species, including common nettle, black elder, and meadowsweet, showcasing their broad pollination role.\n\nThe research aims to determine the viability of the pollen after these long journeys and to understand the physiology that enables hoverflies to undertake such extensive migrations. Ongoing collaboration with oil rig workers like Craig Hannah allows for continued sample collection and study of different hoverfly species and their pollen preferences. This collaboration underscores the importance of citizen science in ecological research.\n",

    "summary": "This article traces the historical roots of America's dependence on ultraprocessed foods, highlighting how convenience, marketing, and agricultural policies fueled their dominance. Initially developed for wartime use, these shelf-stable, additive-rich foods were quickly adapted for civilian consumption after World War II, marketed as time-saving and nutritious alternatives to home-cooked meals.\n\nThe 1970s saw a surge in grain production due to fertilizer and subsidy advancements, leading to an influx of cheap ingredients like high fructose corn syrup used extensively in ultraprocessed foods. Aggressive marketing campaigns, particularly targeting children, further solidified their presence, blurring the line between advertising and entertainment. Tobacco companies diversified into the food industry and employed marketing techniques used to sell cigarettes, further pushing the consumption of these products.\n\nBy the late 20th century, the rise in obesity spurred the creation of \"healthier\" ultraprocessed options, but these failed to curb the problem. Recent research has linked these foods to various health issues, prompting public figures to condemn them and advocate for change.

    "url": "https://www.worldlabs.ai/blog/rtfm",
    "summary": "The RTFM (Real-Time Frame Model) is a programming model and design methodology for developing real-time embedded systems, especially those with hard real-time constraints. It aims to simplify development and verification by providing a structured and predictable approach to managing concurrency and timing.\n\nKey features of RTFM include:\n\n*   **Static Scheduling:** RTFM promotes a statically scheduled task execution. This allows for compile-time analysis and guarantees about the system's timing behavior, crucial for hard real-time systems.\n*   **Resource-Centric View:** Instead of focusing solely on tasks, RTFM prioritizes resource management. Tasks are viewed as consumers of resources, and resource allocation is carefully controlled.\n*   **Lock-Free Synchronization:** RTFM utilizes lock-free data structures and message passing, avoiding the unpredictable latencies associated with mutexes and locks. This contributes to deterministic execution times.\n*   **Hardware-Software Co-design:** RTFM encourages tight integration between hardware and software. Custom hardware accelerators and peripherals can be seamlessly integrated into the RTFM framework.\n*   **Prioritized Interrupts:** RTFM leverages hardware-supported prioritized interrupts to handle external events with minimal latency.\n*   **Code Generation & Verification:** RTFM is often supported by tools that automate code generation and formal verification of the system's timing properties, ensuring correctness and safety.\n\nIn essence, RTFM offers a framework for building real-time systems with predictable timing, allowing for more reliable and robust embedded applications. Its structured approach makes it easier to reason about the system's behavior and verify its compliance with stringent real-time requirements.\n",

    "summary": "This article delves into using Bazel remote execution in conjunction with remote caching to enable safe cross-user result sharing, addressing the limitations of using remote caching alone. The key lies in the trusted environment provided by remote workers, where actions are executed in isolation, allowing for the safe storage of results in the Action Cache (AC) and Content Addressable Storage (CAS).\n\nHowever, ensuring security requires more than just a trusted worker. Network access within the worker must be restricted to prevent tampering with downloaded content. Additionally, the article stresses the importance of protecting the AC by restricting writes exclusively to remote workers. Even with this protection, disabling local result uploads is not enough as malicious users can still modify the Bazel flags.\n\nThe article introduces the \"invocation policy\" feature, an undocumented mechanism in Bazel to enforce specific command-line flag settings, preventing users from bypassing remote execution. It provides examples of how to use invocation policies to restrict flag values.\n\nFinally, a case study illustrates how a poorly configured CI environment with `--remote_local_fallback` enabled could poison the AC with incompatible action results. The solution involves flushing the cache, setting `--remote_local_fallback_strategy=sandboxed`, and ensuring that remote execution is reliable without local fallback. The ultimate goal is to prevent Bazel from injecting AC entries for actions that don't run in remote workers, establishing a chain of trust between sources and production artifacts.\n",

Unlike remote caching alone, remote execution isolates action execution, preventing tampering from the Bazel client and ensuring that the outputs stored in the Action Cache (AC) and Content Addressable Storage (CAS) are trustworthy.\n\nThe article details the interactions between Bazel, the workers, and the AC/CAS, emphasizing that once an action is in the remote execution system, Bazel can't interfere with its execution or output storage. However, security relies on the workers themselves being secure, requiring measures such as disabling network access to prevent malicious code from poisoning the cache with compromised downloads.\n\nEven with secure workers, securing the end-to-end build requires preventing clients from writing to the AC and bypassing remote execution, which is achieved through network-level ACLs and Bazel's \"invocation policy\" feature. Invocation policies allow setting, overriding, or restricting command-line flag values to enforce consistent security policies, such as forcing the use of remote execution for specific actions.\n\nA case study illustrates a potential outage where a local fallback mechanism (--remote_local_fallback) resulted in a corrupted action result being injected into the AC, highlighting the importance of preventing local uploads and ensuring the reliability of remote execution.

    "summary": "This article addresses the problem of blurry pixel art when scaling it up using bilinear filtering. While bilinear filtering smooths out the jagged edges from nearest-neighbor scaling, it can excessively blur pixel art, especially at high magnification. The solution is \"sharp bilinear filtering,\" which blends pixels only at the edges of texels, maintaining sharpness elsewhere.\n\nThe author explains the theory behind sharp bilinear filtering, deriving the mathematical formula for blending based on the fractional texel coordinate and a border width parameter (α), representing the blending region. This formula is implemented as a piecewise linear function, optimized using clamped linear functions to improve shader performance.\n\nThe border width (α) needs to be calculated dynamically based on the magnification level, which is achieved using GLSL functions `dFdx()` and `dFdy()` (or `fwidth()`) to determine the texel-per-pixel ratio.\n\nThe author then provides the GLSL code for implementing sharp bilinear filtering in both OpenGL 3.2 and OpenGL 2.1, highlighting the similarities and differences. The code includes vertex and fragment shaders, demonstrating how to calculate the blend factor and sample the texture accordingly. Finally, the article discusses the necessary changes to the framework code to accommodate the new uniforms: the texture dimensions and blend border width.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the challenging mathematics behind ocean wave behavior and recent breakthroughs in understanding wave instabilities. For centuries, mathematicians have struggled to fully grasp the complex dynamics of even simple waves, described by the seemingly straightforward Euler equations. A major obstacle has been understanding why steady, rolling waves (Stokes waves) eventually become unstable and break down despite minimal friction.\n\nA team of Italian mathematicians, led by Alberto Maspero, Massimiliano Berti, Paolo Ventura, and Livia Corsi, have made significant progress. They've provided a proof regarding the conditions under which these instabilities occur, building upon earlier observations by Bernard Deconinck and Katie Oliveras. Deconinck and Oliveras had computationally discovered an unexpected pattern: as the frequency of disturbances impacting Stokes waves increases, alternating intervals of instability (isole) and stability emerge, stretching infinitely.\n\nThe Italian team, with help from Doron Zeilberger and his computer, proved that these \"isole\" are real, meaning that specific high-frequency disturbances can also destroy waves. This provides critical insight into which disturbances will disrupt Stokes waves and which won't. This research, part of a larger \"renaissance\" in the field, relies on advanced computational tools and sophisticated mathematical techniques, leading to a deeper mathematical understanding of ocean waves and their complex behavior.\n",

    "summary": "This article discusses how Google DeepMind and Yale University collaborated to develop C2S-Scale, a new 27 billion parameter foundation model based on the Gemma family, designed for single-cell analysis. This model successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cellular behavior that was subsequently validated experimentally, revealing a promising new pathway for cancer therapies.\n\nC2S-Scale was tasked with finding a drug that could boost immune signals in \"immune-context-positive\" environments (tumors with low levels of interferon) to make \"cold\" tumors \"hot\" and more responsive to immunotherapy. The model simulated the effect of over 4,000 drugs in both immune-context-positive and immune-context-neutral settings.\n\nThe model identified silmitasertib (CX-4945), a CK2 inhibitor, as a promising candidate, predicting it would significantly increase antigen presentation in the immune-context-positive setting but not in the neutral one. This was a novel hypothesis as silmitasertib's effect on antigen presentation wasn't previously known.\n\nLab experiments on human neuroendocrine cell models confirmed the model's predictions.  Silmitasertib alone had no effect, low-dose interferon had a modest effect, but the combination of both significantly amplified antigen presentation.  The model's in silico prediction was thus validated in vitro.\n\nThe success demonstrates the potential of large language models to accelerate biological discovery by generating biologically-grounded hypotheses. The research team is now exploring the mechanism further and testing additional AI-generated predictions in other immune contexts. The C2S-Scale 27B model and its resources are now available for the research community to use.\n",

The goal was to leverage the static analysis capabilities of applicative functors for efficient batching.\n\nThe \"handle pattern\" involves passing a record of functions (a \"handle\") representing side effects instead of directly executing them.  This is similar to dependency injection and enhances testability and flexibility. `hoistHandle` allows modification of the monad used by the handle.\n\nA free applicative `Query` was created over a basic `OneQuery` type (representing a single request with parsing), using `Control.Applicative.Free`.

It uses `Validation` and `Compose` to accumulate errors while executing actions in a specified monad.  The handle pattern enables decoupling and facilitates testing.\n\nThe article also demonstrates how to extract a list of all requests from a `Query` using `runAp_`, enabling optimizations like deduplication and batching.  A mechanism for saving request-response pairs and constructing a handle from them is presented, allowing for pure testing with captured real requests.\n\nIn summary, the combination of free applicatives and the handle pattern provided a flexible, testable, and optimizable solution for interacting with the ERP system, enabling efficient batching and static analysis while maintaining a clear abstraction boundary.\n",

The report contradicts Justice Kavanaugh's assertion that citizens are promptly released when their status is confirmed.\n\nThe investigation found instances of citizens being physically mistreated, including being dragged, beaten, and tased. It highlights cases of pregnant women and children, including those with cancer, being detained. While immigration agents have the authority to detain individuals suspected of being in the country illegally or those interfering with officers, ProPublica found that a disproportionate number of detained citizens are Latino.\n\nMany citizens arrested for allegedly interfering with or assaulting officers have had their cases dismissed or charges never filed. The report cites examples of citizens, like Leonardo Garcia Venegas, who were detained despite presenting valid identification. Garcia Venegas was detained twice by agents who ignored his REAL ID. The report also details the case of veteran George Retes, who was held for three days after being caught in a raid.\n\nExperts suggest these detentions are increasing due to large-scale immigration sweeps targeting communities. The investigation raises concerns about racial profiling and the violation of constitutional rights, warning that any citizen could be targeted.

    "summary": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is warning of potential economic troubles lurking beneath the surface, drawing parallels to the early signs of the 2008 financial crisis. His concerns stem from recent bankruptcies, specifically Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto-parts supplier.\n\nTricolor's bankruptcy highlights the strain on Americans due to high living costs and a struggling job market, with rising car prices and loan defaults. JPMorgan itself incurred a $170 million loss related to Tricolor.\n\nFirst Brands' bankruptcy exposed a complex web of \"off-balance sheet financing,\" where the company allegedly used the same invoices multiple times to secure loans from private lenders without proper disclosure. This opaque practice draws comparisons to the accounting schemes used by Lehman Brothers before its collapse in 2008. The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into the matter.\n\nDimon's \"cockroach theory\" suggests that these bankruptcies might be indicative of wider, systemic problems that could become more apparent during an economic downturn. He emphasizes the importance of vigilance, cautioning that risky portfolios like those of Tricolor and First Brands will likely face increased scrutiny. He suggests this downturn is partially due to increased stress on American businesses from tariffs.

    "summary": "In October 2025, the FDA issued recalls for frozen shrimp and spices contaminated with cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, primarily linked to products processed by Indonesian firm BMS Foods. The contamination was discovered at U.S. ports, sparking an investigation that traced the source to a steel manufacturer, Peter Metal Technology, near BMS Foods. The manufacturer likely smelted scrap metal containing cesium-137, releasing a radioactive plume that contaminated the surrounding area.\n\nWhile radiation levels detected in the shrimp and cloves were below FDA's intervention level and not considered an immediate threat, the agency initiated recalls and sweeping new import requirements for shrimp and spices from Java and a nearby region due to potential long-term health risks from repeated exposure.\n\nExperts like Steven Biegalski of Georgia Tech emphasize that consumers shouldn't panic, comparing the radioactivity levels to those found in bananas. However, the FDA's actions reflect a concern over potentially higher levels of contamination entering the supply chain. The FDA has placed BMS Foods and the spice exporter on import alert, barring their products from the U.S. until the issue is resolved.

    "summary": "This Backblaze article revisits the classic \"bathtub curve\" of hard drive reliability, challenging its traditional U-shaped representation. Based on 13 years of drive data, Backblaze's analysis suggests that hard drives are getting better and lasting longer.\n\nThe article compares bathtub curves from 2013, 2021, and 2025, revealing a significant shift. The 2025 data shows a much lower peak Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) of 4.25% at 10 years, 3 months, compared to 13.73% (3 years, 3 months) in 2013 and 14.24% (7 years, 9 months) in 2021. This indicates improved drive longevity and a shift in the failure peak toward the end of the drive's lifespan. Early failure rates are also lower in the 2025 data.\n\nThe article also discusses factors influencing the data, such as the size and composition of the drive pool, changes in drive purchasing and decommissioning practices, and the shift from consumer to enterprise-grade drives. Buying in bulk can introduce model-specific weaknesses. Decommissioning functional drives also reduces the observed failure rate, and newer drive standards may also have an effect.\n\nThe authors argue that the bathtub curve is an incomplete model because it only considers time, ignoring factors like workload, manufacturing variations, firmware updates, and operational churn. While data centers strive for consistent conditions, real-world factors always impact reliability. Backblaze encourages readers to explore the publicly available Drive Stats dataset and anticipate future updates on drive reliability trends.\n",

    "url": "https://www.datagubbe.se/ramdisk/",
    "summary": "This article explores the unique and useful RAM and RAD disk features of the Amiga computer, especially relevant given its era of floppy disk reliance. The Amiga offered an out-of-the-box, automounting RAM disk that dynamically allocated memory, unlike other systems requiring user setup or third-party tools.\n\nThe RAM disk, automatically created on boot, used system RAM as a temporary storage space. It's dynamic nature meant it grew and shrank with file creation and deletion, maximizing available RAM. It was used for clipboards, storing environment variables, and unpacking archives, providing a significant speed boost compared to floppies.\n\nThe RAD disk (\"Recoverable RAM Disk\") was a fixed-size RAM disk that emulated a floppy drive and survived warm boots. This allowed for a faster, though smaller, bootable system on RAM, freeing up floppy drives. While limited to Amiga-friendly file systems, it provided a substantial improvement over constantly swapping floppies.\n\nThe article highlights how even with hard drives, the RAM and RAD disks remained valuable for their speed. The \"Slam Tilt\" game example demonstrates a creative use of a custom, small RAD disk to overcome memory limitations on a hard drive-equipped A1200, allowing the game to run without needing floppy disks.\n\nIn conclusion, the Amiga's RAM and RAD disks offered a practical and clever solution to the performance limitations of floppy-based systems, showcasing the Amiga's flexibility and the ingenuity of programmers working within limited resources. Even today, these features remain useful for Amiga users.\n",

He highlights the excitement of seeing the previously developed code come to life, with the model generating text after being trained on a small dataset.\n\nGiles emphasizes the importance of typing in the code yourself, but notes that variations in randomness can lead to slightly different results compared to the book. He also delves into the use of optimizers like AdamW, which dynamically adjust the learning rate during training, and notes that Muon seems to be a popular optimizer as well. He observes the significant speed difference between training on a CPU (MacBook Air) and a GPU (RTX 3090).\n\nHe expresses interest in exploring the cost of training a 124M-parameter model on his own hardware or rented GPUs, referencing Andrej Karpathy's efficient llm.c system, and speculates on whether he could train on the 10B-token FineWeb dataset.\n\nGiles clarifies his understanding of \"memorization\" in the context of language models and discusses techniques like temperature scaling and top-k sampling to avoid \"parroting.\" He recommends copying the load_weights_into_gpt function from GitHub to load the OpenAI GPT-2 weights. Finally, he corrects a previous misunderstanding, noting that only the 124M GPT-2 model has 768 embedding dimensions.

    "url": "https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/",
    "summary": "This article introduces Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a novel inference strategy designed to overcome the limitations of long-context processing in standard language models (LMs), particularly the \"context rot\" phenomenon. RLMs enable LMs to decompose and recursively interact with extensive input contexts through environments like Python REPL, effectively bypassing context window limitations.\n\nThe core concept involves a \"root LM\" that receives the initial query and can then utilize the REPL environment to analyze and manipulate the full context. Crucially, the root LM can spawn recursive calls to other LMs (or even itself) to process specific parts of the context, thereby avoiding performance degradation associated with overly long contexts. The article highlights that this approach allows for more efficient parsing and reasoning over extremely large contexts.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RLMs using GPT-5-mini in a Python REPL environment, showing that it outperforms GPT-5 on the challenging OOLONG long-context benchmark. RLMs also excel on a new Deep Research task created from BrowseComp-Plus and, surprisingly, maintain performance even with context exceeding 10 million tokens. The authors suggest that RLMs represent a promising direction for scaling inference-time computation, offering a learnable trajectory for interaction and recursion over context, without requiring models to handle huge context lengths in a single call. The article positions RLMs as a significant step beyond CoT-style and ReAct-style models.\n",

Unlike traditional methods requiring periodic syncs, ImapGoose leverages modern IMAP extensions like CONDSTORE, QRESYNC, and NOTIFY to achieve near-instantaneous synchronization of changes, minimizing network traffic and processing.\n\nIt works by maintaining a local status database mapping server UIDs to local filenames, inspired by OfflineIMAP. Upon startup, ImapGoose lists mailboxes, sets up monitoring via NOTIFY and inotify/kqueue, and queues a full sync for each mailbox. It determines if a mailbox is new by checking the database and uses HIGHESTMODSEQ to request only changes. A dispatcher manages sync tasks to prevent concurrent mailbox updates and deduplicate redundant tasks. Inotify events trigger targeted syncs for individual messages changed locally.\n\nImapGoose handles disconnections gracefully with exponential back-off retries. Prioritizing efficiency and simplicity, it focuses on modern servers, leveraging UIDPLUS for new message UIDs. Development prioritized a single use case – synchronizing mailboxes with a modern IMAP server – enabling a focused approach. It uses the go-imap library, extending it with NOTIFY and VANISHED support. The configuration uses a straightforward scfg format.

The author emphasizes simplicity and directness, advocating for \"just talking\" to the AI, rather than relying on complex harnesses or sub-agent architectures.\n\nThe author uses `codex cli` with `gpt-5-codex` for most tasks, finding it a good balance of smarts and speed. They run multiple agents in parallel within a terminal grid, each making atomic git commits. The \"blast radius\" concept is key, aiming for small, isolated changes to maintain a clean commit history and ease of rollback.\n\nThey've moved away from Claude Code due to its verbose language and occasional unreliability, preferring the \"introverted engineer\" approach of Codex. Codex offers benefits such as a larger usable context window, more efficient token usage, message queuing, and superior speed.\n\nThe author critiques the trend of complex agentic engineering tools, seeing them as temporary fixes for model inefficiencies. They also dismiss the sub-agent approach, preferring to manage tasks in separate terminal panes for greater control. The article advocates for short, direct prompts supplemented with screenshots for context, and the use of tools like `tmux` for background tasks. The author emphasizes the importance of focusing on the model's inherent capabilities rather than relying on elaborate orchestration or \"MCPs\" (which are often better implemented as CLIs).

While Uttarakhand is being developed as an energy state through hydropower, the Tehri dam and other projects contribute to environmental degradation. Similarly, the construction of the Zoji La tunnel in Ladakh, while strategically important for military troop deployment, utilizes destructive blasting techniques that destabilize the terrain and threaten wildlife.\n\nThe article emphasizes that these projects, including hydropower plants, railways, highways, and tunnels, are being undertaken without adequate urban planning or environmental considerations. This has led to significant issues, exemplified by the land subsidence in Joshimath, Uttarakhand, where hundreds of homes have become uninhabitable. Studies link this subsidence to hydropower projects like the Tapovan Vishnugad plant.\n\nLocals interviewed express concerns that military and economic agendas are prioritized over community safety and ecological preservation. The use of dynamite for construction destabilizes the mountains, endangers wildlife, and exacerbates vulnerabilities in these sensitive regions.

    "summary": "Okay, here's a summary based on the title \"Leaving serverless led to performance improvement and a simplified architecture\" and assuming it details a company's experience with moving *away* from a serverless architecture:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe article details Unkey's decision to move away from a predominantly serverless architecture for their core API, resulting in improved performance and a simplified overall system. Initially, Unkey adopted serverless (specifically AWS Lambda and related services) for its scalability and cost-effectiveness during early stages. However, as the company grew and their API demands increased, they encountered several challenges.\n\nThe main issues with their serverless setup included:\n\n*   **Performance bottlenecks:** Cold starts and inherent latency in Lambda functions impacted API response times, negatively affecting user experience. They struggled to optimize for consistent low latency.\n*   **Architectural complexity:** Managing the myriad of serverless components (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.) led to a complex and difficult-to-debug architecture. Tracing requests and identifying performance issues became cumbersome.\n*   **Cost predictability:** While serverless can be cost-effective at low volumes, unpredictable usage patterns made cost optimization difficult and, at times, expensive.\n\nTo address these issues, Unkey migrated their core API to a more traditional server-based architecture, likely involving dedicated servers or virtual machines. This allowed them to:\n\n*   **Gain greater control over resources:** They could optimize server configurations and fine-tune performance to meet specific API demands.\n*   **Reduce latency:** By eliminating cold starts and minimizing network hops, they achieved significant performance improvements.\n*   **Simplify the architecture:** The transition resulted in a more streamlined and easier-to-manage system.\n\nThe article likely concludes that while serverless can be a good fit for certain use cases, it's not a silver bullet.

    "summary": "David Jones's article \"Pica Numbers\" explores the unique characteristic of many typewriter Pica fonts where numbers are taller than capital letters, a feature often overlooked in discussions of typography. He posits that this phenomenon, while common on typewriters, is rarely acknowledged in mainstream typography resources.\n\nThe article showcases various Pica fonts from classic typewriters like the Olympia SM4, IBM Selectric, Olivetti Lettera 22, Olivetti Valentine, and Hermes 3000, highlighting the variations in number styles (ascending, descending, lining) across different manufacturers and models. He notes that the shapes of specific numerals, like the \"3\" and \"7\", also vary, even within the same brand.\n\nJones argues that while these differences might not warrant considering each a truly distinct font, they are significant variations on a central \"ur-Pica\" concept. He emphasizes that \"Pica\" should be considered a font style or idea.\n\nHe contrasts these \"numbers bigger than capitals\" Picas with lining Picas, where numbers are the same height as capitals, as seen on the Imperial The Good Companion Nº 1 and Royal 10.\n\nThe author laments the neglect of typewriter fonts in mainstream typographical discourse, citing the absence of this unique feature in standard texts. He raises the question of what exactly defines a \"Pica\" font, suggesting it's a topic worthy of further exploration. The article concludes with an appendix explaining why some typewriters lack \"1\" and \"0\" keys, and acknowledgements.\n",

    "url": "https://www.paranetics.com/copy-of-home",
    "summary": "This article introduces the ParaNetic magnet, a novel magnetic technology poised to revolutionize electric motor design and various other applications. Unlike conventional magnets with a single north and south pole, the ParaNetic magnet features a unique three-pole configuration: two north poles with a south pole in between, or vice versa. This unique \"virtual\" magnet allows objects to pass through its magnetic field, enabling advanced motor designs and functionality.\n\nThe ParaNetic electric motor leverages both sides of the rotor and stator magnetic fields simultaneously, boosting efficiency, torque, and performance while reducing heat. This is a significant advantage over traditional motor designs that utilize only one side of the magnetic field. The ParaNetic magnet also allows for suspending permanent magnets at polarity switch points, with uses in valves, transducers, and ion propulsion systems.\n\nApplications for this technology are vast, including improved electric motors, miniaturized transducers, high-fidelity micro-speakers, linear acceleration systems, precise magnetic valves, sensitive sensors, magnetic brakes and bearings, and magnetic springs.\n\nThe ParaNetic motor uses five electromagnets to one permanent magnet, resulting in a motor that requires less current and generates less heat, increasing efficiency. The rotor incorporates hollow-core permanent magnets, which redistribute the magnetic field strength toward the edges, enhancing performance.\n\nThe article concludes that the ParaNetic motor and magnet offer unique characteristics and advantages, marking a promising future for efficient and sustainable propulsion across numerous industries. The text also touches upon the nature of magnetism, the standard arrangement of north and south poles and the role of magnets in emerging electric aircraft.\n",

    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the article:\n\nIn October 2025, CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency) issued a warning about an \"imminent risk\" posed by nation-state hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in F5 products (BIG-IP hardware and software). This followed F5's disclosure that its network was breached, resulting in the theft of source code, vulnerability details, and customer configuration data. CISA mandated federal agencies to update their F5 systems by October 22nd. The agency warned that exploitation could allow attackers to move laterally, steal data, and establish persistent access.\n\nThe article highlights the timing of the warning, coinciding with a government shutdown. A CISA executive, Nick Andersen, blamed Congressional Democrats for the shutdown, arguing that it was straining the nation's defenses and forcing employees to work without pay. He claimed the shutdown and staffing cuts had not impacted CISA's response to the F5 vulnerability, despite reports of nearly 1,000 job cuts this year. While Andersen didn't specify the goals of the nation-state actors, he noted that they typically aim to maintain persistent access for future attacks or information gathering.\n",

While currying and tuples offer workarounds, they feel unnatural. This asymmetry becomes particularly problematic when dealing with asynchronous functions.\n\nThe author proposes a more symmetric approach for asynchronous operations using a modified `then` function that allows multiple synchronous functions as arguments. This `then` function leverages a novel `call_by_need` mechanism. `call_by_need` takes a tuple of functions and a tuple of arguments, attempting to call each function with the earliest, longest possible sequence of arguments. Unused arguments are passed along, void returns are filtered, and failure to call a function results in an error.\n\nBy enabling `then` to accept multiple functions, the asynchronous pipeline can now handle multiple return values, restoring symmetry. This allows for scenarios where an asynchronous function can produce zero, one, or many results, providing greater flexibility and compositionality.

    "title": "New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques from Brains of Mice Within Hours",
    "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours",
    "summary": "This article discusses a promising new Alzheimer's treatment that, in mice, clears amyloid-beta plaques from the brain within hours by repairing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Researchers from China and Spain developed nanoparticles that, instead of merely attempting to cross the BBB, actively repair its function.\n\nThe approach targets endothelial LRP1, which is crucial for removing amyloid-beta at the BBB. By restoring the functionality of the brain's vasculature, the nanoparticles help to clear accumulated amyloid-beta and other harmful molecules, allowing the brain to regain balance.\n\nIn mice with Alzheimer's-mimicking genes, the treatment resulted in a nearly 45% reduction in amyloid-beta clumps within hours of the first injection. Cognitive function, specifically spatial learning and memory, improved to levels comparable to healthy mice, and these benefits lasted for at least six months.\n\nThe researchers propose that a weakened or impaired BBB contributes to Alzheimer's by preventing the efficient removal of waste products. By repairing the BBB, the treatment addresses this underlying issue.\n\nWhile the results are encouraging, experts caution that success in mice doesn't guarantee success in humans, as there are differences in brain vasculature. Moreover, the study focused on a specific subtype of dementia and involved a small sample size. However, the findings add to growing evidence that repairing the BBB could be a novel and effective approach to treating Alzheimer's disease.\n",

    "title": "A modern approach to preventing CSRF in Go",
    "url": "https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/preventing-csrf-in-go",
    "summary": "This article explores a modern approach to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) prevention in Go using the standard library's `http.CrossOriginProtection` middleware introduced in Go 1.25. The middleware checks the `Sec-Fetch-Site` and `Origin` headers to verify the request origin and rejects cross-origin requests.\n\nWhile robust and easy to use, `http.CrossOriginProtection` alone isn't sufficient because older browsers lack the necessary headers. The author suggests that enforcing HTTPS and TLS 1.3, combined with `http.CrossOriginProtection` and `SameSite` cookies, can significantly reduce CSRF risks. TLS 1.3 ensures major browsers support the necessary headers or `SameSite` cookies.\n\nHowever, there are still some risks. Firefox versions 60-69 and obscure browsers might pose a threat. `SameSite` cookies mitigate the Firefox risk. The article distinguishes between cross-site and cross-origin requests, clarifying that `http.CrossOriginProtection` blocks cross-origin requests, offering broader protection.\n\nThe author outlines specific conditions for relying on this approach without token-based CSRF checks. These include enforcing HTTPS and TLS 1.3, handling safe methods correctly, using both `http.CrossOriginProtection` and `SameSite` cookies, assessing risks from other websites under the same domain, ensuring there is no HTTP version of your application origin or you are including a HSTS header on your HTTPS responses, and accepting the risks from non-major browsers with limited header support. The author advises against this approach if the application is a high-value target.\n",
