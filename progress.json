    "title": "Google *Unkills* JPEG XL?",
    "url": "https://tonisagrista.com/blog/2025/google-unkills-jpegxl/",
    "summary": "This article discusses the surprising reversal of Google's decision to remove JPEG XL support from Chromium. Despite initially dismissing the format due to perceived lack of interest and incremental benefits over existing formats like AVIF, the Chromium team has reconsidered, prompted by community pressure and significant developments.\n\nThe author highlights that in late 2025, JPEG XL support is still limited to Safari and niche browsers. However, Chromium's newfound openness to a \"performant and memory-safe\" JPEG XL decoder signals a potential shift towards widespread adoption.\n\nThe article recounts the initial rejection of JPEG XL despite positive feedback from major players like Meta, Intel, and Adobe. The author emphasizes the community's strong advocacy, Firefox's interest in a Rust-based decoder, and the PDF Association's intent to adopt JPEG XL as a preferred image format.\n\nThe author strongly advocates for JPEG XL, listing its superior features, including lossless JPEG re-compression, wide gamut and HDR support, large image size support, high bit depth and channel support, resilience to generation loss, progressive decoding, animation support, and alpha transparency. He concludes that JPEG XL is the future of image formats and expects Chromium's support to be a crucial step towards its mass adoption.\n",
    "chinese_title": "谷歌 *扼杀* JPEG XL？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了谷歌出人意料地撤销从Chromium中移除JPEG XL支持的决定。尽管最初因认为缺乏兴趣且与AVIF等现有格式相比增益不明显而驳回了该格式，但在社区压力和重大发展推动下，Chromium团队重新考虑了这一决定。\n\n作者指出，到2025年末，JPEG XL的支持仍然仅限于Safari和一些小众浏览器。然而，Chromium对“高性能和内存安全”的JPEG XL解码器的新接受态度预示着该格式可能被广泛采用。\n\n文章回顾了最初拒绝JPEG XL的情况，尽管它收到了来自Meta、Intel和Adobe等主要参与者的积极反馈。作者强调了社区的强烈倡导、Firefox对基于Rust的解码器的兴趣，以及PDF协会采用JPEG XL作为首选图像格式的意图。\n\n作者强烈倡导JPEG XL，列举了其卓越的特性，包括无损JPEG重新压缩、广色域和HDR支持、大图像尺寸支持、高位深和通道支持、对世代损失的抵抗力、渐进式解码、动画支持和Alpha透明度。他总结说，JPEG XL是图像格式的未来，并期望Chromium的支持将是其大规模采用的关键一步。"

    "title": "A New AI Winter Is Coming",
    "url": "https://taranis.ie/llms-are-a-failure-a-new-ai-winter-is-coming/",
    "summary": "The author argues that a new \"AI winter\" is approaching due to the fundamental limitations of transformer-based AI models, despite their initial promise. While transformers have overcome some previous AI challenges, like scaling and NP-completeness, they are inherently prone to \"hallucinations\" - generating plausible but incorrect output.\n\nThe author explains that transformers work by predicting the most plausible next token in a sequence, regardless of whether that token is factually accurate or logically sound. This leads to a failure rate that is unacceptable for many practical purposes, especially when larger models produce convincing but wrong outputs that only experts can identify.\n\nThe author draws parallels to the dot-com bubble, where overhyped technologies led to widespread corporate failures and investor losses. He predicts that generative AI projects, particularly those based on unrealistic expectations, will suffer the same fate, causing major crashes for companies like OpenAI and a pullback in AI infrastructure spending.\n\nSpecific examples, like AI-assisted programming, highlight the danger of relying on transformers without expert oversight, as subtle errors can lead to significant problems. The author cautions against using transformers in fields where errors can have serious consequences, such as medicine, law enforcement, and education. He anticipates that while the technology won't disappear entirely, its applications will be limited to a few \"killer app\" use cases, with the rest fading away.\n",
    "chinese_title": "新一轮人工智能寒冬将至",
    "chinese_summary": "作者认为，尽管基于Transformer的AI模型最初展现出潜力，但由于其根本局限性，一场新的“AI寒冬”正在逼近。Transformer模型虽然克服了一些先前的AI挑战，如扩展性和NP完备性，但它们本质上容易出现“幻觉”——即生成看似合理但实则不正确的输出。\n\n作者解释说，Transformer模型的工作原理是预测序列中最合理的下一个标记，而不管该标记在事实上是否准确或在逻辑上是否合理。这导致了对于许多实际用途来说不可接受的失败率，特别是当更大的模型产生看似令人信服但却是错误的输出，并且只有专家才能识别时。\n\n作者将此与互联网泡沫相提并论，当时过度炒作的技术导致了广泛的企业倒闭和投资者损失。他预测，生成式AI项目，特别是那些基于不切实际期望的项目，将遭受同样的命运，导致像OpenAI这样的公司遭遇重大崩溃，并导致AI基础设施支出回落。\n\n诸如AI辅助编程之类的具体例子，突显了在没有专家监督的情况下依赖Transformer模型的危险，因为细微的错误可能导致严重的问题。作者告诫不要在错误可能造成严重后果的领域（如医疗、执法和教育）中使用Transformer模型。他预计，虽然这项技术不会完全消失，但其应用将仅限于少数“杀手级应用”用例，其余的将会逐渐消失。"

    "url": "https://xania.org/202512/01-xor-eax-eax",
    "summary": "This article explains why compilers often use `xor eax, eax` instead of `mov eax, 0` to set the EAX register to zero in x86 assembly.  While seemingly obscure, `xor eax, eax` achieves the same result with fewer bytes (two versus five), leading to smaller program size and more efficient use of the instruction cache.\n\nThe key advantage goes beyond code size: modern x86 CPUs recognize `xor eax, eax` as a common \"zeroing idiom\" and optimize it out of the execution pipeline.  The CPU understands that the new value of EAX is independent of its previous value, allowing it to allocate a fresh, dependency-free register and effectively remove the `xor` operation from the execution queue, resulting in zero execution cycles.\n\nThe article also highlights why `xor eax, eax` is preferred over `xor rax, rax` (the 64-bit version). Writing to the 32-bit EAX register automatically zeros the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit RAX register, achieving the desired result in a single, optimized instruction.  Finally, it notes the convention of using the 32-bit variant (e.g., `xor r8d, r8d`) even for extended registers like R8, possibly for compiler simplicity. In essence, `xor eax, eax` offers both code size reduction and performance optimization.\n",

    "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the article \"Cartographers Have Been Hiding Covert Illustrations Inside of Switzerland's Maps\":\n\nThe article details the long-standing tradition of Swiss cartographers embedding small, often humorous, illustrations within official Swiss maps. These covert images, ranging from animals and mythical creatures to everyday objects and scenes, are hidden in remote or seemingly unimportant areas of the maps, intended as a playful inside joke for the cartographers and a subtle embellishment for those observant enough to find them.\n\nThe practice dates back decades and serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it acts as a safeguard against copyright infringement. If a map is copied, the presence of these unique illustrations can prove the original authorship. Secondly, it's a way for the cartographers to inject a bit of personality and creativity into what can be a highly technical and regulated field. Finally, it fosters a sense of community and shared knowledge amongst the mapmakers.\n\nThe article emphasizes that these hidden illustrations are not disruptive to the map's primary function; rather, they are subtle additions that add a layer of intrigue and character to Switzerland's cartographic history. The images are typically small and blend into the landscape, rewarding careful examination of the maps and adding to their appeal. The article highlights examples of these illustrations and discusses the overall culture of meticulousness and attention to detail that permeates Swiss mapmaking.\n",

    "summary": "In \"Google, Nvidia, and OpenAI,\" Ben Thompson analyzes the evolving AI landscape, positioning it as a hero's journey where OpenAI and Nvidia are facing their greatest ordeal: Google striking back.\n\nGoogle's Gemini 3 has demonstrated competitive performance, challenging OpenAI's dominance in model quality, while Google's potential sale of TPUs directly threatens Nvidia's high margins in the AI chip market. Thompson questions which company is more at risk, noting Nvidia's profitability versus OpenAI's financial losses.\n\nHe argues that Nvidia's former moats of superior performance, flexibility, and CUDA ecosystem are being challenged. Hyperscalers have the resources to develop alternative software stacks, diminishing CUDA's lock-in. Nvidia is responding with initiatives like DGX Cloud and NIMs.\n\nIn contrast, OpenAI benefits from two large markets: developers using their API and consumers using ChatGPT. Consumers' daily engagement with ChatGPT creates a powerful moat difficult for Google to overcome, fighting individual by individual.\n\nThompson suggests that ChatGPT should adopt an advertising model, arguing it would enhance the product, expand the user base, and deepen OpenAI's moat. He positions ChatGPT in the lower left of his \"Moat Map,\" highlighting that by commoditizing suppliers with a large number of users, they can monetize attention via advertising.\n\nWhile Google is a fierce competitor with advantages, such as leading image and video generation, Thompson posits that changing the habits of millions of ChatGPT users is a significant challenge for Google.\n",

While the author appreciates the Matrix protocol's functionality and Synapse's reliability and well-documented API, they highlight several significant drawbacks.\n\nSynapse lacks a built-in admin panel, requires PostgreSQL which grows rapidly (requiring constant cleanup and vacuuming), keeps orphaned rooms and attachments, and doesn't allow user deletion, raising GDPR concerns. The initial setup presumes federation, which is difficult to disable.\n\nThe article criticizes the direction of the Matrix-Element ecosystem, particularly the new Element Server Suite (ESS) Community, deeming its Kubernetes requirement overkill for small deployments. The author prefers the simplicity and efficiency of XMPP-based Snikket.\n\nThe author also assesses the Element clients. While Element Classic offers cross-platform consistency, it lacks image captions and suffers from slow notifications and unclear offline indications. Element X is deemed slower, has problematic conversation sorting, lacks background sync, and requires a server-side \"sliding sync\" option. Calls on Element X are incompatible with older versions. Onboarding, especially with Element X, is a major pain point, making it difficult for new users to create simple username/password accounts.\n\nUltimately, the author concludes that the new corporate-focused ESS and increasingly crippled Synapse/Element X are unsuitable for their needs and plans to migrate to Snikket due to its efficiency, smooth onboarding, and timely notifications.\n",

While Fleming's initial observation of mold inhibiting staphylococcus growth is well-known, the article presents evidence suggesting the story might be flawed.\n\nSeveral points are raised: Fleming's lab window was rarely open, the story mirrors a previous discovery, the lab notebook entry is dated almost two months after the supposed discovery date, and, most crucially, penicillin only works when present before staphylococcus growth, contradicting the idea of it dissolving already established colonies. Replicating Fleming's experiment has proven difficult.\n\nThe article details the science behind penicillin's mechanism, explaining how it inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis during growth, thus rendering it ineffective on mature colonies. This challenges the notion that penicillin could have cleared established staphylococcus colonies as depicted in Fleming's initial account.\n\nThe lack of contemporary records corroborating the discovery date and the late first recorded mention of penicillin in Fleming's lab notebook are also questioned.\n\nFinally, it introduces Ronald Hare's theory, suggesting that the history of the culture plate and the mold itself may be different than previously thought.

The central idea is that LLMs are stateless; `CLAUDE.md` is the primary means of providing necessary context about your project.\n\nA good `CLAUDE.md` should cover the \"WHAT\" (tech stack, project structure), \"WHY\" (purpose of the project and its components), and \"HOW\" (project workflow, verification methods). However, the article emphasizes that \"less is more\" because Claude can only reliably follow a limited number of instructions (150-200). Overloading `CLAUDE.md` decreases overall performance.\n\nThe article advocates for concise and universally applicable content in `CLAUDE.md` and suggests a \"Progressive Disclosure\" approach. Instead of stuffing all instructions into `CLAUDE.md`, store task-specific instructions in separate markdown files and instruct Claude to selectively read them when needed.\n\nAvoid using Claude as a linter; use deterministic tools for code style. Leverage existing code patterns within your codebase instead of explicit instructions. The document also advises against auto-generating `CLAUDE.md`, stressing the importance of carefully crafting its content. In essence, a well-written `CLAUDE.md` should provide just enough information for Claude to understand the project's fundamentals and how to access more specific details when required.\n",

    "summary": "A new study provides the first direct evidence of lightning on Mars, detected through sounds and electrical signals captured by the Perseverance rover. Researchers analyzed 28 hours of audio recordings from the rover's microphone, identifying 55 events characteristic of lightning over two Martian years. These events correlated strongly with strong winds, dust devils, and dust storms, suggesting that wind plays a key role in generating these discharges.\n\nUnlike Earth's thunderstorms, Martian lightning is likely driven by the friction of dust particles rubbing against each other within dust devils, similar to how dust devils on Earth can generate electric charges. Previous studies had theorized the existence of this \"dry lightning\" on Mars, but direct evidence had been elusive. This new study provides that unprecedented acoustic confirmation.\n\nThe discovery deepens our understanding of the Martian atmosphere and has potential implications for future robotic and human missions. The electrostatic discharges could pose a threat to rovers and astronauts, highlighting the need for a better understanding of these phenomena to protect future explorers.

    "url": "https://ssg.dev/isnt-wsl2-just-a-vm/",
    "summary": "This article delves into the nature of WSL2, addressing the question of whether it's \"just a VM.\" It begins by explaining the concept of \"subsystems\" in Windows NT, highlighting their role in providing API translation layers for running applications from other operating systems. WSL1 is presented as a translation layer, offering minimal overhead but suffering from I/O performance issues.\n\nWSL2, on the other hand, is described as a full-blown Linux VM running on Hyper-V, designed to overcome WSL1's performance limitations. While acknowledging its VM nature, the author argues that WSL2 is more than just a standard VM. It features dynamic memory allocation, seamless integration with Windows (mounting Windows drives, accessing Linux drives via network shares, and utilizing WSLg for GUI apps), and a Microsoft-provided, customizable Linux kernel.\n\nThe article highlights WSL2's benefits (faster performance, real Linux kernel) and drawbacks (slower startup, memory overhead, file management challenges). A key issue is file storage; storing work within the WSL2 disk image (.vhdx file) presents data management concerns, while using Windows drives results in slower performance. The author recommends using separate VHDX images for serious work to mitigate these issues.\n\nUltimately, while technically a VM, the author concludes that WSL2's features and integrations justify considering it a \"subsystem\" to distinguish it from typical heavyweight VMs. It offers a good balance of performance and integration, making it a valuable tool for developers and users needing Linux environments on Windows.\n",

The article recommends borders composed of repeating elements of similar width.\n\n2.  **Vectorizing the image:** Converting the image into a vector graphic in Inkscape using the \"Trace to Bitmap\" function.\n\n3.  **Separating elements:** Using Inkscape tools (\"Split Path\", \"Difference\", and \"Fracture\") to isolate each repeating element in the border pattern.\n\n4.  **Standardizing element width:** Adjusting the width of each element to be identical using the \"Paste Size Separately\" function to enable predictable repetition in CSS.\n\n5.  **Arranging the elements:** Distributing the elements horizontally with no spaces in between using Inkscape's Align and Distribute Grid function.\n\n6.  **Exporting as SVG:** Saving the created pattern as a \"Plain SVG\" file.\n\n7.  **Creating CSS:** Implementing the repeating background on an `<hr>` element using CSS. Crucially, the article demonstrates how to use the `round()` function to ensure that the width of the `<hr>` element is always a multiple of the repeating element's width, thus preventing cut-off patterns. The author gives `width: round(down,100%,22px);` as an example where 22px is the width of a single repeating element.\n\nThe article addresses potential issues with `max-width` properties interfering with the rounding function and suggests solutions like wrapping the `<hr>` in a `<div>` or using `!important` in the CSS.

The developer announced that the computer used to create the official APKs was infected, leading to the unintentional release of malware-infected versions. Versions 30.43 and 30.47 from APKMirror are confirmed to be infected, potentially explaining why Google and Amazon forcibly uninstalled SmartTube on some devices.\n\nThe developer has since wiped the compromised machine and released a clean version, SmartTube 30.56, with a new digital signature. Older versions have been removed from GitHub as a precaution. Users are advised to install the latest version using specific Downloader codes (28544 for stable, 79015 for beta).\n\nWhile the exact capabilities of the malware are unknown, it's believed the primary risk is related to YouTube account control, given the app's limited permissions. To mitigate potential risks, users who installed or updated SmartTube in November are strongly advised to factory reset affected devices and audit their Google and YouTube account activity.\n\nElias Saba from AFTVnews suggests that uninstalling the infected app might suffice for cleaning, but a factory reset provides a guaranteed solution. Restoring settings from a backup of a compromised app is considered safe as it contains only text files.

    "summary": "This article delves into the surprisingly flexible nature of Windows drive letters, revealing they aren't limited to the A-Z range. The author demonstrates this using the `subst` command, creating drive aliases like \"+:\".\n\nThe core argument is that drive letters are a convention stemming from the conversion of Win32 paths (like \"C:\\foo\") to NT namespace paths (like \"\\??\\C:\\foo\"). The Object Manager, which handles NT paths, treats drive letters as symbolic links within the \"\\??\" virtual folder. The function `RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U` is key in converting Win32 paths to NT paths, and it treats \"+:\\foo\" similarly to \"C:\\foo\".\n\nThe author explores practical implications, noting limitations in Explorer and PowerShell, which often restrict drive letters to A-Z. Non-ASCII drive letters are also possible, though their implementation has caveats. The article highlights inconsistencies in how different functions interpret paths with non-standard drive letters, particularly regarding encoding and path classification (absolute vs. relative). Finally, a bizarre quirk with `SetVolumeMountPointW` is exposed, where it truncates non-ASCII drive letters, unexpectedly creating different mount points. The author concludes that Windows path handling can be surprisingly idiosyncratic.\n",

This decision stems from several issues with GitHub, including its heavy reliance on JavaScript (making it unusable with Dillo itself), its centralized control (posing a single point of failure risk), increasing slowness, a \"push model\" notification system, inadequate moderation tools, and the encouragement of LLMs, which impacts Dillo users.\n\nThe new setup involves a purchased domain (dillo-browser.org) and a small VPS hosting the Dillo website and its source code using cgit for a lightweight, JavaScript-free git frontend. A custom bug tracker, \"buggy,\" has been developed to store bug reports as plain Markdown files within a git repository, mitigating data loss risks. Mailing list archives are handled by external services.\n\nTo ensure redundancy, the git repositories are mirrored on Codeberg and Sourcehut. While a single point of failure still exists with the DNS entry, alternative communication channels and updated mirrors can help recover from a DNS loss.

Specifically, it focuses on a question posed by Paul Erdős (Erdős Problem #124).\n\nThe problem defines sets $P(d,k)$ as integers formed by sums of distinct powers $d^i$ where the exponent $i$ is greater than or equal to $k$. It then asks whether, given a set of integers $d_1 < d_2 < \\cdots < d_r$ satisfying the condition $\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq r}\\frac{1}{d_r-1}\\geq 1$, all sufficiently large integers can be represented as a sum of the form $\\sum_i c_ia_i$, where $c_i$ is either 0 or 1, and $a_i$ belongs to the set $P(d_i,0)$.\n\nFurthermore, the problem considers a stronger condition: if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers $d_1, \\ldots, d_r$ is 1, can all sufficiently large integers be represented as a similar sum $\\sum_i c_ia_i$, but now with $a_i$ belonging to the set $P(d_i,k)$ for any $k \\geq 1$?\n\nThe title suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) has proven the problem, implying that AI has successfully shown that the representation of sufficiently large integers described in the problem is indeed possible under the given conditions. Therefore, the main point is the positive resolution of Erdős Problem #124 using AI.\n",

    "url": "https://foxmoss.com/blog/dote/",
    "summary": "This blog post details a project to replace a traditional Linux window manager with Google Chrome, aiming for easier customization. The author created \"DoteWM,\" a window manager where the browser handles window decorations, background, and interactions.\n\nThe approach leverages X11 for window display, but delegates window management to a web browser via Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). CEF allows the author to load HTML/JavaScript files directly from the system without HTTPS, using a custom \"dote://\" scheme.  A C++ interface using CEF's `cefQuery` provides communication between the browser and the underlying system. This establishes an event loop allowing Javascript to call C++ functions, essentially controlling the window manager.\n\nThe actual window manager is written in C++ utilizing OpenGL for compositing. This involves retrieving window textures from the X11 display server and rendering them. Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between the browser and window manager is handled with nanomsg over UNIX sockets, employing Protobuf for serialization and type annotation.  A flow control mechanism prevents message overload.\n\nThe project implements window decorations, window movement via Javascript, and addresses window overlapping issues by rendering textures to polygons, creating a cropped window that acts as a border.  Window icons are converted to PNG data URLs for easy browser integration. A demo of a Windows 98 style window manager is provided. The code is open source and available on Github.\n",

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588",
    "summary": "This arXiv article (arXiv:2211.12588) introduces \"Program of Thoughts\" (PoT) prompting as a method to improve language models' performance on numerical reasoning tasks. The authors, led by Wenhu Chen, argue that the existing Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) prompting approach, which uses language models for both reasoning and computation, can be improved by disentangling these two processes.\n\nPoT prompts the language model (specifically Codex) to express the reasoning steps as a program. This program is then executed by an external computer to derive the final answer. This separation allows the language model to focus on the reasoning logic, while the computation is handled externally, potentially improving accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe authors evaluated PoT on five math word problem datasets (GSM, AQuA, SVAMP, TabMWP, MultiArith) and three financial-QA datasets (FinQA, ConvFinQA, TATQA) in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. The results demonstrate that PoT consistently outperforms CoT, achieving an average performance gain of around 12% across all datasets. Combining PoT with self-consistency decoding further enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on all tested math problem datasets and near-SoTA performance on financial datasets. The code and data are available on Github. The paper was published at TMLR 2023.\n",

    "summary": "Mary Roach's article \"How to Print a Human\" explores the cutting-edge field of 3D bioprinting and its potential to address the critical shortage of transplantable organs. The article delves into the decell/recell process, where organs are stripped of their cells (decellularized) leaving behind a collagen scaffold, which is then repopulated (recellularized) with a patient's own cells to avoid immune rejection.\n\nHowever, the article highlights the significant challenges in recellularizing these scaffolds, as cells struggle to navigate the complex capillary networks. This leads to the exploration of 3D bioprinting, which involves building tissues and scaffolds layer by layer using specialized \"bio-inks\" containing cells and extracellular matrix.\n\nRoach visits Adam Feinberg's lab at Carnegie Mellon, where researchers are developing the FRESH (Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels) technique to support the printing of delicate structures within a gel bath. The article explores the complexities of creating functional tissues, including maintaining cell viability, ensuring proper cell differentiation and organization, and promoting vascularization within the printed tissue. While promising, the article emphasizes the limitations of current bioprinting techniques, particularly in replicating the strength and functionality of complex tissues like cartilage and muscle. The piece concludes with a tempered view on the progress of bioprinting, acknowledging that while strides have been made, recreating functional organs remains a complex and distant goal.\n",

    "summary": "This article investigates potential safety issues in Haribo-branded power banks and headphones, which were popular for their high capacity, low weight, and appealing design before being pulled from Amazon due to unspecified \"safety or quality issue\".\n\nUsing CT scans, the investigation reveals significant battery defects in all examined products, indicating a lack of quality control during manufacturing. The power bank showed poor edge alignment in its pouch cells, potentially leading to dendrite formation, battery failure, and even thermal runaway.\n\nThe headphones fared worse. The noise-canceling earbuds had torn cathode layers and inconsistent anode overhang. The basic earbuds and charging cases also exhibited poor anode overhang, far below industry standards.\n\nThese defects, particularly the lack of proper anode overhang, increase the risk of premature battery failure and potential fire hazards. The small, enclosed spaces of earbuds and headphones exacerbate these risks by providing limited ventilation. The findings suggest that all Haribo-branded products use batteries from the same low-quality supplier, prioritizing specifications and aesthetics over safety and reliability, thus explaining the products' removal from Amazon. The article highlights the importance of internal battery structure for safety and consistent performance, which cannot be compensated by attractive specifications.\n",

    "summary": "This document describes `NVMe2K`, an experimental NVMe driver for Windows 2000, targeting both x86 and Alpha AXP platforms. It enables the use of modern NVMe SSDs on this legacy operating system by functioning as a SCSI miniport driver integrated through the `ScsiPort` framework.\n\nThe driver implements NVMe 1.0 specification support, utilizing a single I/O queue pair, an admin queue for device management, and PRP-based data transfers up to 2MB. It features a SCSI Translation Layer to convert SCSI commands into NVMe commands, including READ, WRITE, FLUSH, INQUIRY, and READ_CAPACITY. Key components include `nvme2k.c` (main logic), `nvme2k_nvme.c` (NVMe controller logic), `nvme2k_scsi.c` (SCSI command handling), `nvme2k_cpl.c` (completion handling), and `nvme2k.h` (data structures).\n\nBuilding the driver requires the Windows 2000 DDK and Visual C++ 6.0, with separate build instructions provided for x86 and Alpha AXP. Installation involves creating a driver disk with appropriate binaries and INF file, then using Device Manager or the Add Hardware Wizard. Configuration options like `MaximumSGList`, `NumberOfRequests`, and `MaxQueueDepth` are available through registry settings.\n\nLimitations include single I/O queue pair, no MSI/MSI-X support, limited concurrent large transfers, and lack of namespace and power management support.  It is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD License and provided \"as is\" with no warranty. Contributions for multi-queue support, MSI-X implementation, and performance improvements are welcomed. The author acknowledges the NVMe specification authors, the Windows 2000 DDK documentation, and others for their assistance, as well as those who advised against the project.\n",
