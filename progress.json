    "summary": "The author recounts their unexpected trip to Greenland, initially spurred by a casual agreement. Facing pre-trip anxieties fueled by underwhelming travel videos, they braced for a bleak experience. The journey began with a frustrating flight that ended in a return to the starting point due to fog, highlighting the unpredictable travel conditions.\n\nUpon finally arriving, Greenland presented a stark contrast: a calm and collected populace against a dramatically inhospitable landscape. Nuuk, the capital, felt both peaceful and surreal with its traffic jams in a small city. The author then journeyed to Ilulissat, plagued by intense mosquito swarms and the sight of sled dogs in harsh conditions.\n\nThe trip included a boat tour where the author's daughter enjoyed eating glacier ice. Observations about Greenland's culture, including whale consumption and the use of industrial fishing methods, challenged preconceived notions. The author highlighted the perplexing presence of luxury cars in a place with limited roads, as well as the oddities of the local grocery store and local cuisine.\n",

    "url": "https://github.com/francoismichel/ssh3",
    "summary": "SSH3 is a new take on the SSH protocol, built on top of HTTP/3, aiming for faster session establishment and enhanced security features. It leverages QUIC+TLS 1.3 for secure connections and HTTP Authorization for user authentication. Key benefits include significantly faster session setup (3 round-trip times vs. SSHv2's 5-7), support for modern authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and improved robustness against port scanning by allowing the server to be hidden behind a secret URL.\n\nOther advantages include UDP port forwarding, connection migration (planned), and multipath connections, all enabled by the underlying QUIC protocol. It supports common password and public-key authentication (RSA, EdDSA/ed25519).\n\nImportantly, SSH3 is currently experimental and not recommended for production environments without thorough security review. Community feedback and expert analysis are encouraged.\n\nSSH3 offers features like X.509 certificate authentication for the server, keyless user authentication via OpenID Connect, and supports OpenSSH features like authorized_keys parsing, ssh-agent integration, TCP port forwarding, and proxy jump.\n\nThe document provides instructions on how to install SSH3 from source or using `go install`, deploy an SSH3 server (including generating Let's Encrypt certificates or self-signed certificates), and use the SSH3 client for private-key, agent-based, or password-based authentication. It also explains how to configure SSH3 using an OpenSSH-like configuration file.\n",

    "summary": "This article from BackKoi Research details the discovery of the first malicious MCP server, \"postmark-mcp,\" which has been backdoored to steal emails. MCP servers are tools used by AI assistants to automate tasks like sending emails and database queries, often with broad permissions. The \"postmark-mcp\" package, downloaded 1,500 times weekly, was found to be copying all emails to the attacker's server, giftshop.club, since version 1.0.16.\n\nThe attacker impersonated the legitimate Postmark package on npm, adding a single line of code that BCCs every email. This highlights a significant security risk: developers often trust and integrate these tools without proper vetting, granting them extensive access to sensitive data. The article emphasizes that traditional security measures often fail to detect such threats as developers independently adopt AI tools that operate outside established security perimeters.\n\nThe impact is potentially massive, affecting hundreds of organizations and thousands of emails daily. The author stresses the inherent vulnerability of the MCP ecosystem, where AI assistants blindly execute commands from untrusted sources. They recommend immediately removing the compromised package, rotating exposed credentials, and auditing all MCP servers for suspicious activity. Koi's risk engine and supply chain gateway are presented as solutions for detecting and preventing similar threats. The article urges heightened paranoia and vigilance in the context of MCP server usage.\n",

Written in Rust and Apache-2.0 licensed, Typst aims to offer a simpler markup system, faster compilation, and easier customization while maintaining high-quality output comparable to LaTeX.\n\nThe article highlights LaTeX's strengths as a long-standing standard for technical documents, but acknowledges user dissatisfaction stemming from its large installation size, slow compilation, cryptic error messages, and arcane macro language for customization.\n\nTypst, developed since 2019, addresses these issues with a less verbose, more readable markup syntax inspired by Markdown, and clearer, color-coded error messages. It also offers a \"watch\" mode for live preview during editing. The author praises Typst's integrated programming language (similar to Rust), superior handling of floating figures and tables, and its initial adoption by scholarly journals.\n\nDrawbacks include a lack of specialized packages compared to LaTeX's vast ecosystem, documentation issues, and potential for breaking changes during its early development. However, the ease of programming and the responsive development team are seen as strengths. While journal template support is limited, Pandoc can convert Typst to LaTeX. The author concludes they are using Typst for a physics paper, using Pandoc to convert to LaTeX, praising its math equation handling and syntax-aware editor support and predicts Typst may eventually replace LaTeX. The key to long term success will be maintaining forward compatibility with user documents.\n",

    "summary": "This article explains the fundamentals of virtual memory, a crucial concept in modern operating systems. It begins by highlighting the necessity of main memory (RAM) for fast data access compared to slower disk storage. Since registers are limited, main memory serves as a large, addressable space for programs and data.\n\nThe article then discusses a simple memory allocation strategy (contiguous blocks) and its drawback: external fragmentation. To address this, it introduces paging, where memory is divided into fixed-size frames and processes use virtual memory, an abstraction mapped to physical memory by the OS. Virtual memory is divided into pages, which are mapped to frames using page tables. Key concepts like page numbers, frame numbers, and offsets are explained. Different page table structures (multi-level, hashed, inverted) are also introduced.\n\nDemand paging is then covered, explaining how only necessary pages are loaded into memory, improving efficiency. Page faults occur when an accessed page is not in memory, triggering the OS to load it. Metrics like RSS (physical memory usage) and VSZ (total virtual memory allocated) are defined.\n\nFinally, the article details virtual memory layout, outlining segments like the kernel space, stack, memory-mapped regions, heap, and code/data segments. It provides specifics on stack allocation, explaining how it grows and shrinks with function calls, and the role of stack pointers. It also touches on thread stacks, their default sizes, and relevant system calls.\n",

    "url": "https://medium.com/@yingjunwu/the-case-for-hybrid-cache-for-object-stores-4b1f02ec6c9a",
    "summary": "This article introduces Foyer, a Rust-based hybrid caching library developed by RisingWave to address the latency challenges of using Amazon S3 as a primary storage layer in modern data systems. While S3 offers scalability, durability, and low cost, its high latency and per-access costs can significantly hinder performance, especially for latency-sensitive applications like RisingWave, a streaming database.\n\nFoyer combines a memory cache for low-latency access and a disk cache for expanded capacity, managed by a coordinator that unifies the two layers. The memory cache prioritizes speed with sharding and request deduplication, while the disk cache offers modular engines for different data profiles and flexible I/O options.\n\nFoyer operates in hybrid mode (memory and disk) and memory-only mode, with a consistent API for seamless adoption. Benefits include improved latency, reduced S3 costs, increased capacity, and configurability. RisingWave uses Foyer in a three-tier storage architecture (memory, local disk, S3) to minimize S3 accesses, controlling latency and reducing costs.\n\nThe article details RisingWave's specific integration strategies, including block-level reads, sparse indexes, prefetching, and cache hydration. Foyer is deeply integrated, managing I/O, providing access pattern feedback, and working with RisingWave's compaction process. The conclusion emphasizes that hybrid caching is becoming a necessity for object-store-based architectures to support real-time and high-throughput workloads.\n",
    "chinese_title": "我构建了 Foyer：一个能大幅降低 S3 延迟的 Rust 混合缓存。",
    "chinese_summary": "本文介绍了RisingWave开发的基于Rust的混合缓存库Foyer，旨在解决在现代数据系统中使用Amazon S3作为主存储层时面临的延迟挑战。虽然S3具有可扩展性、持久性和低成本的优点，但其高延迟和每次访问成本会显著降低性能，特别是对于像RisingWave这样的流数据库等对延迟敏感的应用。\n\nFoyer结合了用于低延迟访问的内存缓存和用于扩展容量的磁盘缓存，并由协调器统一管理这两个层。内存缓存通过分片和请求去重来优先考虑速度，而磁盘缓存提供用于不同数据配置文件的模块化引擎和灵活的I/O选项。\n\nFoyer以混合模式（内存和磁盘）和仅内存模式运行，并具有一致的API以实现无缝采用。其优点包括改善延迟、降低S3成本、增加容量和可配置性。RisingWave在三层存储架构（内存、本地磁盘、S3）中使用Foyer，以最大限度地减少S3访问，从而控制延迟并降低成本。\n\n本文详细介绍了RisingWave的具体集成策略，包括块级读取、稀疏索引、预取和缓存补水。Foyer被深度集成，管理I/O，提供访问模式反馈，并与RisingWave的压缩过程协同工作。结论强调，混合缓存正成为基于对象存储的架构支持实时和高吞吐量工作负载的必要条件。"

The Pi 500+ includes a built-in M.2 NVMe SSD, 16GB of RAM, and the new RGB-backlit mechanical keyboard.\n\nThe keyboard features Gateron KS-33 Low Profile Blue switches and standard keycaps, which are easily removable and replaceable. Larger keys are braced for stability. The keyboard is pre-programmed with multiple RGB lighting effects configurable through Raspberry Pi's keyboard tools, and runs on an RP2040 microcontroller with a Pi fork of the QMK firmware, potentially enabling compatibility with VIA (or Vial) for further customization.\n\nThe author describes the keyboard as \"clickety-clack,\" measuring around 60 dBa at 1' distance. While personally preferring quieter switches, the author found the keyboard a significant improvement over the flat keyboards of previous Raspberry Pi models. The article explores swapping keycaps, demonstrating compatibility with both low-profile and (with some caveats) full-height options, allowing for customization of the look and feel.\n\nThe author concludes that the keyboard is a major upgrade compared to past Pi keyboards, comparing favorably to a mid-range mechanical keyboard. While the lack of switch swapping is a downside for those who dislike blue switches, the overall build quality and customizability with keycaps make it a welcome addition. The separate keyboard top shell opens possibilities for future modifications.\n",

    "summary": "A lifetime of strong social connections, termed \"cumulative social advantage,\" can slow biological aging at the molecular level, according to research published in *Brain, Behavior and Immunity - Health*. The study, analyzing data from over 2,100 adults in the MIDUS study, found that individuals with higher levels of cumulative social advantage showed slower epigenetic aging, measured by \"epigenetic clocks\" like GrimAge and DunedinPACE, and lower levels of chronic inflammation.\n\nCumulative social advantage encompasses early-life parental warmth and support, community and religious engagement, and ongoing emotional support from friends and family. Researchers found that this advantage was linked to lower levels of interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory molecule associated with age-related diseases.\n\nThe study highlights that social resources, like economic ones, accumulate over a lifetime, leading to disparities. Those disadvantaged in material ways may also lack sustained social support, potentially accelerating aging. The findings support the \"weathering hypothesis,\" suggesting that adversity leads to earlier health deterioration.\n\nResearchers emphasize the importance of consistent and deep social connections built over decades, suggesting they act like a \"retirement account\" for health, with earlier and consistent \"investments\" yielding greater biological returns.

    "title": "Why We Think",
    "url": "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2025-05-01-thinking/",
    "summary": "This article explores the benefits of \"thinking time\" for large language models (LLMs), drawing analogies to human cognition and computation. It discusses how allocating more computational resources at test time, through techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), can significantly improve model performance.\n\nThe article frames CoT as a form of latent variable modeling, where the model generates intermediate reasoning steps (the latent variable) to arrive at a final answer. This allows for more complex and nuanced problem-solving. The article then contrasts two primary methods for utilizing test-time compute: parallel sampling and sequential revision.\n\nParallel sampling involves generating multiple outputs simultaneously and selecting the best one based on a scoring function (e.g., best-of-N sampling, beam search with process reward models). Self-consistency, which chooses the answer with the majority vote among CoT rollouts, falls under this category.\n\nSequential revision, on the other hand, involves iteratively refining the model's responses based on previous outputs, akin to reflecting and correcting mistakes. This approach often requires fine-tuning a \"corrector\" model, as LLMs don't intrinsically self-correct effectively. Techniques like self-correction learning and recursive inspection aim to train these corrector models. SCoRe is a reinforcement learning-based approach for encouraging multi-turn self-correction. The article highlights that integrating parallel and sequential sampling methods can leverage the strengths of both approaches. Easier problems benefit from sequential revision, while harder problems benefit from a mix of both.\n",

    "summary": "This article advocates for \"open social,\" drawing a parallel to the open-source movement. It argues that current social media traps users' data within centralized platforms, hindering their freedom and incentivizing platforms to prioritize profits over user well-being.\n\nThe author proposes a decentralized model where users own their social data, hosted in personal repositories accessible via domain-based handles (e.g., @alice.com). This allows users to control their data and move between social apps without losing their connections and content. The AT Protocol, developed by Bluesky, is presented as a promising approach. It enables a web of hyperlinked JSON data, where each record (posts, likes, follows) has a unique \"at://\" URI, allowing connections across users and apps.\n\nThe article emphasizes that this infrastructure operates behind the scenes for non-technical users, similar to how web servers work. The key benefit is user empowerment: the ability to \"walk away\" from a platform without abandoning their social graph, fostering competition and better user treatment. The author believes that, like open source, open social could take time to become widespread but will ultimately seem inevitable, empowering individuals and reshaping the social media landscape. The goal is to transition from a \"closed social\" model where users are rows in a database to an \"open social\" model where users control their data.\n",

Dating back approximately 18,000 years, the puppy, nicknamed \"Dogor\" (meaning \"friend\" in Yakut), has baffled scientists trying to determine whether it's a wolf or a dog.\n\nExtensive genetic analysis, including sequencing its genome, has failed to conclusively place Dogor on the canine evolutionary tree. While the permafrost preserved the body exceptionally, making it appear recent, the DNA hasn't provided a definitive answer. Researchers believe Dogor lived during a crucial period when dogs were thought to be diverging from wolves. The ambiguous genetic results suggest Dogor could represent a transitional form, a common ancestor, or a very early dog that still shared considerable genetic similarities with wolves.\n\nThe research highlights the difficulty in pinpointing the exact moment of dog domestication. It implies the split between dogs and wolves may have occurred earlier than previously thought and emphasizes the complex and gradual nature of the domestication process. Further research and analysis of similar ancient canines are necessary to better understand the evolutionary history of dogs and their relationship to wolves.

They contend that the hype surrounding AGI, driven by figures like Sam Altman, is disproportionate to its actual imminent possibility, diverting attention and resources from practical AI development and adoption.\n\nThe authors highlight how politicians are increasingly fixated on AGI, leading to policies and investments based on the assumption of its near-term arrival. They counter that AI progress is more likely to be iterative and complex, like other general-purpose technologies, rather than a sudden breakthrough.\n\nChina, they argue, is focusing on the rapid integration and scaling of existing and near-term AI capabilities, particularly in robotics and industry applications. To compete effectively, the U.S. should shift its focus from chasing the \"myth\" of AGI to investing in AI literacy within the government, modernizing infrastructure and data practices, and supporting university research and development. This includes leveraging existing AI infrastructure investments and fostering collaboration between public and private sectors.\n\nBy prioritizing practical AI implementation and adaptation, the U.S. can not only improve its current capabilities but also lay a stronger foundation for future advancements, including the possibility of AGI.

    "summary": "Lumafield's Battery Quality Report, based on CT scans of over 1,000 lithium-ion 18650 batteries from various brands, reveals significant quality disparities, particularly in inexpensive and counterfeit cells. The study focused on anode overhang (AOH) and edge alignment, critical factors affecting battery performance, degradation, and the risk of internal shorts leading to thermal runaway (fires and explosions).\n\nThe research found that low-cost/counterfeit batteries exhibited significantly lower AOH quality and poorer edge alignment compared to OEM cells. Furthermore, the variability in quality within some brands indicated inconsistent process control. A concerning discovery was the presence of \"cathode overhang\" (negative AOH) in 33 cells, exclusively from low-cost/counterfeit brands, which dramatically increases the risk of internal shorts.\n\nThe report emphasizes that even low failure rates can translate to a significant number of incidents in the field due to the sheer volume of batteries in circulation. The study uncovered instances of misleading branding and misrepresented battery capacities in the marketplace.\n\nLumafield advocates for using CT scanning with automated analysis to ensure battery quality, enabling teams to quickly identify defects and take corrective actions. Their industrial X-ray CT platform allows for rapid and scalable inspection, making it practical for modern battery production lines. The study underscores the importance of supply chain control, urging cell makers, pack builders, device integrators, and consumers to prioritize measurable quality to mitigate risks associated with defective batteries.

He highlights the initial excitement of computers' unerring obedience but emphasizes that the true engagement lies in figuring out *how* to command them effectively.\n\nTorvalds draws parallels between computer science and physics, suggesting both explore fundamental truths, but computer science allows you to *create* the world within the computer, granting a god-like control. He likens programming to building a beautiful and creatively designed treehouse, emphasizing that functionality is often secondary to artistry and innovation.\n\nA key appeal is the freedom to create a self-consistent world with its own rules, similar to mathematics. Torvalds uses the Mandelbrot set as an example, demonstrating how computers can visualize abstract mathematical concepts, resulting in beautiful patterns. While much programming involves problem-solving, the ultimate challenge lies in creating an operating system – establishing the fundamental rules within which all other programs operate.\n\nTorvalds emphasizes the value of finding elegant and efficient solutions. He recounts the story of Gauss calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 to illustrate the importance of recognizing patterns and approaching problems creatively. The greatest feeling for a programmer, he concludes, is discovering the right, beautiful way to solve a challenging problem after struggling to find it.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the resurgence of enumerative geometry, a field focused on counting geometric objects that satisfy specific conditions. Once a central area of mathematics, it faded in popularity during the 20th century. However, mathematicians Kirsten Wickelgren and Jesse Kass have revived the field by applying motivic homotopy theory, a sophisticated framework developed in the 1960s and 70s, to address enumerative problems in various number systems, including real, complex, and finite number systems.\n\nThe key breakthrough involves reframing geometric problems as equations and functions describing relationships between spaces, allowing the application of motivic homotopy theory. This approach generates a quadratic form, the signature of which provides valuable information about the number of solutions in different number systems.\n\nThis new approach provides new insights into number systems and allowed them to provide information about problems like determining the number of lines on a cubic surface not just for complex and real numbers but for finite number systems too. The theory not only provides answers but also generates additional information that mathematicians are still working to interpret, sparking renewed interest and drawing new talent to the field. Ultimately, this revival connects enumerative geometry to algebra, topology, and number theory, fulfilling David Hilbert's vision of a more rigorous and versatile approach to these longstanding mathematical challenges.\n",

Emergency generators are currently powering cooling and safety systems after the last power line was severed. The IAEA director, Rafael Grossi, has expressed deep concern, but efforts to reconnect the line are stalled.\n\nUkrainian officials and Western experts suspect Russia is deliberately creating a crisis to solidify its control over the plant, potentially even restarting a reactor despite the dangerous conditions. Stress tests indicate nuclear plants should only operate without external power for 72 hours, and exceeding this is risky.\n\nWhile Russia claims Ukrainian shelling hinders repairs, Ukraine denies targeting the plant. The IAEA reports sufficient diesel for generators for 20 days, but loss of external power increases the risk of an accident. Failure of generators could lead to nuclear fuel overheating and a potential meltdown.\n\nRussia appears to be building a new power line through occupied territories. Greenpeace analysis suggests a new water source may have been created, leading to fears Russia might restart a reactor to demonstrate its control. Greenpeace urged the IAEA to stop Russia's plans for a reactor restart, and the Russian president reassured IAEA of support for its work.

    "summary": "The article addresses the question of why Windows continues to make changes to critical sections, despite them being a mature technology. While bugs may be rare, performance is an ongoing concern. Because critical sections are heavily used, even small performance improvements can yield significant gains.\n\nPast optimizations focused on fairness (avoiding lock convoys) and reducing memory footprint, particularly in non-paged pool, a costly and limited resource. Reducing the amount of non-paged pool used by each critical section is extremely beneficial when these sections are used on a large scale.\n\nMore recent changes aim to detect and mitigate priority inversions. The Windows 11 24H2 optimization moves more of this work to user mode, avoiding costly kernel mode transitions. This specific optimization is what exposed the old GTA San Andreas bug.\n\nIn essence, the article argues that even well-established components like critical sections require ongoing optimization to maintain performance and reliability in ever-evolving computing environments characterized by increased scale, speed, and concurrency.

    "title": "Bad Machinery: Managing Interrupts Under Load",
    "url": "https://log.andvari.net/pages/bad-machinery.html",
    "summary": "This article, \"Bad Machinery: Managing Interrupts Under Load,\" addresses the challenge of balancing project work and operational load (interrupts like pages and tickets) within a team, particularly in SRE. The core argument is that constant context switching between these two drastically reduces productivity and increases stress because \"humans are bad machinery.\"\n\nThe article advocates for *polarizing* time, dedicating specific blocks (ideally a day or week) to either project work or interrupt handling. The key takeaways are:\n\n*   **Avoid mixing project work and interrupts:** If you're oncall, focus solely on oncall duties. Don't try to work on projects concurrently.\n*   **Funnel interrupts:** Structure oncall and ticket handling to concentrate interrupts on dedicated individuals. Randomly assigning tickets across the entire team is counterproductive.\n*   **Adequate staffing:** If the interrupt load is too high for one person, add another. Don't overburden individuals.\n*   **Embrace \"make time\":** Carve out periods for uninterrupted, creative work to foster cognitive flow and improve employee satisfaction.\n*   **Clearly defined roles:** Standardize procedures like pushes and flag flips so that anyone can assume responsibility, avoiding long-term individual ownership.\n\nBy reducing context switches and allowing for focused work, teams can improve productivity, reduce stress, and foster a more positive work environment. The central theme revolves around understanding the cost of context switching for humans and structuring work to minimize it.\n",

    "url": "https://nyulangone.org/news/oral-microbes-linked-increased-risk-pancreatic-cancer",
    "summary": "This study from NYU Langone Health links specific oral microbes to a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Researchers analyzed the saliva of 122,000 individuals, identifying 27 species of bacteria and fungi that, collectively, increased the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by 3.5 times. Notably, the study identified specific Candida species, a type of yeast, found both in the saliva and in pancreatic tumors of patients.\n\nThe research team analyzed the DNA of microbes from saliva samples collected from participants in ongoing cancer prevention studies and followed them for about nine years. By comparing the microbial DNA of 445 pancreatic cancer patients with that of cancer-free individuals, researchers pinpointed specific bacteria and fungi that influenced cancer risk. Some identified bacteria are known to contribute to periodontal disease, further highlighting the link between oral health and pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe findings suggest that profiling oral bacterial and fungal populations could serve as a tool for identifying individuals at higher risk for pancreatic cancer, enabling earlier screening. While the study demonstrates a correlation, it doesn't establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Further research is planned to explore the role of oral viruses and the impact of the oral microbiome on patient survival. The study emphasizes the potential protective effect of good oral hygiene on cancer prevention.\n",

    "title": "How insurance risk is transformed into investable assets",
    "url": "https://riskvest.io/riskvest-insights/transforming-insurance-risk",
    "summary": "This article explains how insurance risk, typically held by insurance companies, can be transformed into investable assets, particularly for retail investors. Insurers operate on a partially collateralized basis, holding capital and surplus less than the total policy limits. This exposes them to potential losses exceeding premiums, requiring capital reserves.\n\nDirect investment in insurance risk is generally restricted for retail investors due to the potential for unlimited losses. To overcome this, fully collateralized structures like Catastrophe Bonds (CAT Bonds) are created. CAT Bonds are similar to corporate bonds, but their principal is at risk if a specified catastrophic event triggers insurance losses for the sponsoring insurance company.\n\nThe article uses a hypothetical CAT bond, \"Gator Re Ltd.\", to illustrate the concept. Risksure Re, a Florida insurer, issues a bond where investors' principal is used to cover hurricane losses exceeding a certain threshold. Investors receive a coupon for taking on this risk, plus income from risk-free assets where the principal is held. In case of a qualifying loss event, investors may lose part or all of their principal.\n\nWhile CAT bonds offer exposure to insurance risk with limited liability, they are not without risks. Once the principal is triggered, it's permanently lost. The author concludes by explaining why insurance companies aren't fully collateralized: it reduces capital efficiency and return on capital. The numerous checks and balances allow for undercollateralization in traditional insurance, whereas full collateralization is vital for external investors to protect their investment.\n",
    "chinese_title": "保险风险如何转化为可投资资产",
    "chinese_summary": "本文解释了通常由保险公司承担的保险风险如何转化为可投资资产，特别是对于零售投资者而言。保险公司以部分抵押的方式运作，其持有的资本和盈余少于保单的总限额。这使得他们面临超过保费的潜在损失，需要资本储备。\n\n由于存在无限损失的可能，零售投资者通常无法直接投资保险风险。为了克服这一点，创建了完全抵押的结构，如巨灾债券（CAT Bonds）。CAT Bonds类似于公司债券，但如果特定的灾难性事件触发了发起保险公司的保险损失，它们的本金将面临风险。\n\n本文使用一个假设的巨灾债券“Gator Re Ltd.”来说明这个概念。Florida保险公司Risksure Re发行了一种债券，投资者的本金用于支付超过一定阈值的飓风损失。投资者因承担这种风险而获得息票，以及持有本金的无风险资产带来的收入。如果发生符合条件的损失事件，投资者可能会损失部分或全部本金。\n\n虽然CAT Bonds提供了对具有有限责任的保险风险的敞口，但它们并非没有风险。一旦本金被触发，它将永久损失。作者最后解释了为什么保险公司没有完全抵押：这降低了资本效率和资本回报率。大量的制衡机制允许传统保险中的抵押不足，而完全抵押对于外部投资者保护其投资至关重要。"
