    "summary": "On December 5, 2025, Cloudflare experienced a 25-minute outage affecting approximately 28% of HTTP traffic due to a flawed code deployment aimed at mitigating the CVE-2025-55182 React Server Components vulnerability. The outage was triggered at 08:47 UTC when a change to the body parsing logic, intended to increase buffer size for WAF analysis, caused errors within Cloudflare's FL1 proxy.\n\nSpecifically, disabling an internal testing tool using a global configuration system propagated a change that triggered a bug in the rules module, leading to HTTP 500 errors. The error occurred because a killswitch applied to a rule with an \"execute\" action resulted in a Lua exception, a longstanding, previously undetected code error.\n\nThe issue impacted customers using the older FL1 proxy with the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset deployed. The change was reverted at 09:12 UTC, restoring full service.\n\nCloudflare acknowledges the unacceptability of the outage, especially following a similar incident on November 18, 2025. They are prioritizing enhancements to their deployment and rollback systems, including enhanced rollouts & versioning, streamlined break glass capabilities, and \"Fail-Open\" error handling. While changes were in progress from the November 18th outage, they were not completed in time to prevent the December 5th event. Cloudflare has temporarily locked down network changes and plans to release a detailed breakdown of ongoing resiliency projects.\n",

The author recounts a personal experience of attempting to resolve significant technical debt by rewriting a duplicated codebase, highlighting how the effort stalled due to resistance to change from developers and a lack of understanding from management.\n\nThe core argument is that factors like poorly defined requirements, unrealistic deadlines, outdated skillsets, and individual egos contribute to technical debt and impede progress. The author realized that addressing these underlying people issues is crucial for effectively resolving technical challenges. He stresses that refactoring efforts often fail because they expose systemic problems with existing software development practices and individual skill gaps.\n\nThe author also reflects on the limitations of an ideal engineering world, devoid of deadlines and \"politics,\" where technical solutions are expected to speak for themselves. Instead, the importance of effective communication with non-technical stakeholders, quantifying the value of technical improvements, and navigating interpersonal dynamics are emphasized as essential skills for senior engineers. The article concludes by contrasting the \"engineer's engineer\" with the \"heads up coder,\" who combines technical prowess with the ability to anticipate risks and guide the team, suggesting the latter is often more valuable for large initiatives.\n",

Here is a summary:\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Network Open, investigated the association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and all-cause mortality over a 4-year period (2019-2022). Using a retrospective cohort study design, the researchers analyzed data from over 670,000 individuals enrolled in a large US integrated health system. They compared mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, adjusting for various demographic factors, pre-existing conditions, and other potential confounders.\n\nThe key findings indicated that mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. Specifically, the study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mortality among vaccinated individuals compared to their unvaccinated counterparts across different age groups and risk categories. The protective effect of vaccination appeared to be most pronounced during periods of high COVID-19 transmission.\n\nThe researchers emphasized that while the study demonstrated a correlation between vaccination and lower mortality, it did not establish a causal relationship. However, the findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing mortality risk. They also highlighted the importance of considering individual risk factors and the evolving landscape of the pandemic when interpreting the results.

    "summary": "This article outlines the design principles of Nimony, a new compiler aiming to become Nim 3.0, emphasizing safety, performance, and a streamlined language experience. A core goal is suitability for hard real-time and embedded systems by ensuring predictable worst-case execution time (WCET).\n\nMemory management is handled through scope-based destructors and move semantics, similar to Nim 2.0, but with simplified MM switches (only `mm:atomicArc`). Cycle collection is being explored via `.cyclic` pragma annotations.\n\nError handling deviates from modern sum types. Nimony prefers integrating error states into objects (e.g., NaN for floats) or utilizing thread-local error variables. Exception handling is retained but requires explicit `{.raises.}` annotations to denote functions with hidden control flow. The new `ErrorCode` enum is introduced for standardized error propagation.\n\nAddressing OOM, Nimony employs an overridable `oomHandler` which records the size of the failed request. `ref object` construction in `.raises` routines automatically maps nil to `ErrorCode.OutOfMemError`.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of generics with complete type checking for custom containers. Concurrency and parallelism are unified under the `spawn` construct, managed by a scheduler that determines thread execution at runtime. Parallelism is further supported by parallel for loops (e.g., `||` iterator).\n\nThe spawn construct is implemented through compiler plugins - an evolution of Nim's macros.

    "url": "https://lyra.horse/blog/2025/12/svg-clickjacking/",
    "summary": "This article introduces \"SVG clickjacking,\" a novel technique that leverages SVG filters to create sophisticated and interactive clickjacking attacks. Unlike traditional clickjacking, which simply overlays an iframe, SVG clickjacking allows attackers to manipulate the appearance and behavior of the targeted iframe content, enabling complex interactions and data exfiltration.\n\nThe author explains how various SVG filter elements, such as `<feImage>`, `<feFlood>`, `<feOffset>`, `<feDisplacementMap>`, `<feColorMatrix>`, and others, can be combined to build attack primitives. Examples include creating fake captchas to trick users into retyping sensitive information and masking techniques to hide placeholder text in input fields, guiding users to enter attacker-chosen data.\n\nA key aspect of SVG clickjacking is the ability to read pixel data from the iframe using filters. This enables the creation of responsive fake buttons and dynamic interface elements. By detecting pixel colors, attackers can trigger different filter effects, mimicking hover states, dropdowns, and even form validation.\n\nThe article further demonstrates how to construct logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.) using `feBlend` and `feComposite`. This makes SVG filters functionally complete, allowing attackers to program complex logic within the filters. As a proof of concept, the author presents an SVG adder circuit, showcasing the ability to implement arbitrary logic circuits, opening up the possibility for more complex, responsive and convincing clickjacking attacks.\n",

    "summary": "A Kenyan high court declared key sections of a 2012 seed law unconstitutional, marking a victory for food security advocates and smallholder farmers. The law, which previously criminalized the sharing and selling of indigenous seeds, threatened farmers with imprisonment and hefty fines for engaging in traditional practices through community seed banks. Justice Rhoda Rutto also ruled against sections allowing government officials to seize seeds from these banks.\n\nThe law was originally intended to combat the sale of counterfeit seeds, which caused significant losses in the agricultural sector, and gave trading rights to licensed companies only. However, 15 farmers challenged the law, arguing that it infringed on their ability to preserve and share seeds, a practice vital for food security.\n\nThe court's decision vindicates traditional farming methods, allowing farmers to freely share and save seeds without fear of legal repercussions. Food campaigners like Elizabeth Atieno of Greenpeace Africa hailed the ruling as a blow against corporate control of the food system, ensuring farmers can use climate-resilient, locally adapted seeds. Indigenous seeds are valued for their drought resistance and adaptability, often outperforming hybrid varieties in their native areas. While Kenya has a national seed bank, community seed banks are considered equally important for seed variety and accessibility to farmers.\n",

    "summary": "A new 3D scan of the Rano Raraku quarry on Easter Island suggests the island's famous moai statues were carved by independent groups, rather than a centrally controlled workforce. Researchers, led by Carl Philipp Lipo, created a detailed 3D model from over 11,000 photographs, revealing 30 distinct quarrying areas with unique carving styles. This indicates that moai production reflected the island's decentralized social structure, with separate family groups independently working while sharing techniques.\n\nThe study challenges the long-held assumption that large-scale monument projects require strict hierarchy and unified control. The similarities in moai design are attributed to shared cultural knowledge, not coordinated labor. The model also identified multiple transport routes, further supporting the decentralized carving theory.\n\nThe research provides a valuable dataset for future investigations and cultural management of the UNESCO World Heritage site. The team used methods that could be applied to other archaeological sites.

It transforms tail-recursive functions into iterative loops at decoration time, offering performance gains of 1.41x to 2.88x compared to standard recursion.\n\nThe library is installed via `pip install tacopy-optimization` or `uv add tacopy-optimization` and used by decorating tail-recursive functions with `@tacopy`. It works by using AST transformation to convert the function into a `while` loop with variable assignments.\n\nTacopy requires functions to be module-level, non-async, and have all recursive calls in tail position (immediately returned). The decorator includes validation to ensure functions meet these criteria, raising a `TailRecursionError` if they don't. A function `show_transformed_code` allows viewing the transformed code for debugging.\n\nBenchmarks demonstrate significant speedups and more consistent performance compared to standard recursion.

    "summary": "**Ephemeral Infrastructure: Why Short-Lived Is a Good Thing - Summary**\n\nThe article argues that using ephemeral infrastructure, meaning infrastructure designed to be automatically provisioned and destroyed after a short lifespan, offers significant benefits in modern software development and deployment. Traditional, long-lived infrastructure, while familiar, presents challenges like configuration drift, inconsistent environments, and difficulty in rolling back changes.\n\nEphemeral infrastructure addresses these issues by promoting immutability. Each environment is created from a defined state (e.g., through Infrastructure as Code) and any necessary changes are applied during the provisioning process, resulting in a consistent and reproducible environment. Once its task is complete (e.g., running a specific set of tests or serving a particular deployment version), the infrastructure is destroyed and not modified.\n\nKey benefits highlighted include:\n\n*   **Reduced configuration drift:** Infrastructure is consistently recreated from a known good state, eliminating inconsistencies that accumulate over time.\n*   **Simplified rollback:** Rolling back to a previous version is as simple as deploying the corresponding infrastructure configuration.\n*   **Improved security:** Short-lived infrastructure reduces the attack surface and duration of potential compromises.\n*   **Faster deployments:** Automation enables quicker and more reliable deployments.\n*   **Efficient resource utilization:** Resources are only used when needed, leading to cost savings.\n\nThe article emphasizes that while implementing ephemeral infrastructure requires an initial investment in automation and tooling (e.g., Infrastructure as Code tools, CI/CD pipelines), the long-term benefits outweigh the costs, leading to more reliable, secure, and efficient deployments.\n",

The author argues that AI's ability to cheaply and precisely shape public opinion transforms preference distribution into a strategic tool for elites.\n\nThe paper presents a dynamic model where elites strategically manipulate policy preferences, considering persuasion costs and majority rule constraints. The model suggests that a single elite's intervention tends to polarize society. Furthermore, improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this polarization.\n\nWhen two opposing elites vie for power, the technology can create incentives to establish \"semi-lock\" regions with cohesive opinions that are resistant to rival influence. Thus, advanced persuasion can either intensify or diminish polarization depending on the competitive environment.\n\nThe core conclusion is that cheaper persuasion technologies reframe polarization as a deliberate governance strategy rather than a purely emergent social phenomenon. This has significant implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities continue to evolve.

Three new studies highlight the following:\n\n*   **Sugars Essential for Life:** Scientists discovered ribose and glucose, vital components of RNA and crucial for energy, respectively. This suggests that building blocks for biological molecules were widespread and that ribose may have been more common than deoxyribose in the early solar system, supporting the \"RNA world\" hypothesis.\n*   **Mysterious, Ancient 'Gum':** A previously unseen gum-like substance rich in nitrogen and oxygen was found. This polymer-like material, formed early in the solar system, could have provided chemical precursors for life on Earth. It's a result of carbamate polymerization and hardened over time, resembling a \"space plastic.\"\n*   **Abundant Supernova Dust:** The samples contained six times more dust from stars predating the solar system than any previously studied astromaterial. This indicates that Bennu's parent body likely formed in a region rich in dust from dying stars.

The core premise is to evaluate the practical capabilities and profitability of AI, specifically LLMs, in real-world financial markets. The experiment tracked the performance of each LLM's trading strategy, analyzing their decision-making processes and investment choices. The goal was to assess whether these AI systems could generate positive returns and outperform traditional investment strategies or benchmarks. The project likely explores various aspects of AI in finance, including natural language processing of financial news, technical analysis, risk management, and trade execution. The results would offer insights into the current state of AI-driven investment and its potential impact on the future of financial markets. Ultimately, the AI Trade Arena aims to determine if LLMs are viable tools for active stock trading.\n",

    "summary": "This article argues against servant leadership, comparing it to \"curling parenting\" where the leader constantly removes obstacles for their team, ultimately hindering their growth and leaving them unprepared when the leader departs. The author proposes \"transparent leadership\" as a more effective approach.\n\nTransparent leadership focuses on empowering team members through coaching, connecting them with resources and other people, teaching problem-solving skills, and clarifying organizational values to enable independent decision-making. It emphasizes direct connection between needs and resources, fostering career growth by gradually transferring leadership responsibilities, continuously training a replacement, and aiming for redundancy.\n\nThe author suggests that a truly effective leader strives to become a high-powered spare worker, returning to technical problem-solving rather than creating unnecessary bureaucracy or inventing new tasks once their leadership role is effectively filled by others. This keeps their skills sharp, earns them respect, and allows them to contribute meaningfully to the team's overall success. In essence, the goal is to empower the team to function independently and effectively, making the leader's role ultimately less critical for day-to-day operations.\n",

    "summary": "This article, titled \"Reframing Impact,\" introduces a sequence of thought experiments and explanations designed to address the problem of AI alignment, specifically how to prevent powerful AI systems with imperfect objectives from causing catastrophic outcomes.\n\nThe author argues for the importance of developing an \"impact measure\" as a crucial safeguard, one that doesn't rely on solving opaque, hard problems upfront. This measure should be mathematically sound and directly implementable in code. The author contrasts this approach with alternatives like Quantilizers, Value Learning, and Corrigibility. They argue that Quantilizers have drawbacks related to handling powerful agents and defining safe base distributions, while Value Learning depends on potentially unachievable perfect assumptions and would fail if the learning goes wrong. Corrigibility, while promising, might not prevent harm if the agent acts too quickly before corrections can be effective.\n\nThe sequence aims to answer three central questions: why do we perceive some things as significant events, why goal-directed AIs are incentivized to cause catastrophic effects by default, and how to build agents that lack those incentives. The initial sections focus on establishing foundational concepts.\n\nThe author emphasizes engaging actively with the material, including completing the exercises with speed and accuracy, to truly understand the underlying problems before exploring potential solutions.

The Lisa was designed for office use, aiming to be user-friendly for those unfamiliar with computers.\n\nThe development of the Lisa began in 1978 as \"Project LISA,\" initially intended as a modern Apple II/III iteration. After a rocky start, Steve Jobs became involved and, inspired by a visit to Xerox PARC, the project shifted towards a GUI-based system. This involved significant changes, incorporating ideas from Xerox's Smalltalk environment, like a mouse-driven interface and bitmapped display. Larry Tesler, a Xerox employee, joined Apple to lead system software development. User testing influenced the \"Lisa User Interface Standards\" document, prioritizing user-friendliness.\n\nThe article then delves into the GUI, highlighting two main user modes: Lisa Office System (LisaOS, the primary GUI environment) and Lisa Workshop (a text-based development environment). The LisaOS aimed to be intuitive and visually driven (WYSIWYG), hiding unnecessary elements until required. The goal was to provide an interface that required no computer knowledge.\n\nThe article sets the stage for future discussions about the Lisa's task-oriented workflow, windowing, desktop utilities, copy-paste functionality, software, hardware, and ultimately, its discontinuation and legacy.

    "summary": "This article explores the surprising trend of increasing numbers of students at elite universities like Stanford, Harvard, and Brown claiming disabilities and receiving academic accommodations. The author questions the validity of such high rates, suggesting it's unlikely that genuinely learning disabled students would be heavily represented in these highly selective institutions. Professors interviewed indicate that many students, especially those from wealthier backgrounds, are seeking diagnoses and accommodations like extra time on tests to avoid bad grades.\n\nThe author highlights the role of mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions becoming \"identity markers,\" fueled by online portrayals of these conditions as broad and encompassing, leading students to self-diagnose based on common struggles. This is exacerbated by increasingly lenient diagnostic criteria for conditions like ADHD. The article also points to a pervasive risk-aversion among high-achieving students, who interpret normal academic challenges as signs of a disability, seeking accommodations as a form of protection against failure and self-doubt. The author argues that these unnecessary accommodations ultimately hinder intellectual growth and the development of crucial life skills, preventing students from tackling real-world challenges effectively.\n",

    "summary": "The article reports on concerns surrounding new vaccine testing standards proposed by Vinay Prasad, MD, MPH, a top vaccine regulator at the FDA. Experts fear these \"impossible\" standards could severely limit the development and availability of life-saving vaccines.\n\nPrasad's internal memo, revealed through social media, suggests requiring pre-market randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for most new vaccines, including those for pregnant women. Experts argue that demanding RCTs for pregnant women is unrealistic due to ethical concerns and potential risks to the fetus. Current practices rely on careful safety monitoring and antibody level measurements.\n\nThe memo also criticizes current testing for pneumonia and flu vaccines. Prasad wants proof that pneumonia vaccines reduce pneumonia cases and suggests more rigorous annual testing for updated flu vaccines. Experts argue that requiring such extensive trials would be time-consuming, costly, and potentially unethical, as it would involve using placebos and leaving individuals vulnerable to preventable illnesses. The fast-changing nature of flu strains also makes yearly RCTs impractical.\n\nCritics say Prasad's memo focuses on potential vaccine risks without acknowledging their benefits or lives saved. They fear the proposed standards could lead to a de facto ban on vaccines due to lack of CDC recommendation or insurance coverage. Legal experts suggest the changes could be challenged in court as \"arbitrary and capricious.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics also expressed concern that the proposed requirements could limit children’s access to safe, proven vaccines.\n",

    "summary": "This article contrasts two approaches to being a Staff+ engineer in Big Tech, arguing that chasing the \"spotlight\" isn't the only path to impact and career success. The author contrasts their career in developer tools and infrastructure with the experience of engineers in product teams, where executive visibility and quarterly goals drive priorities. In infrastructure, the author argues that **stewardship** and long-term ownership provide compounding returns through efficiency, systemic innovation, and the ability to say \"no\" to fleeting trends that threaten system stability (like premature AI integration).\n\nThe author emphasizes that leaving the \"spotlight\" allows for the development of alternative forms of currency: the **\"Shadow Hierarchy\"**, where impressing influential engineers in other organizations becomes more valuable than impressing direct management, and a **\"Utility Ledger\"**, based on metrics like bug fixes, criticality, ubiquity, and scale. These metrics demonstrate real technical impact and are resilient to executive changes.\n\nReferencing Will Larson's Staff Engineer archetypes, the author identifies as an Architect or Tech Lead, focused on long-term ownership. While acknowledging luck in finding the right team, the author insists that choosing to stay and build depth is a conscious decision. The conclusion is that there's a viable and rewarding alternative to the high-visibility, fast-paced world of product engineering, one built on depth, patience, and a lasting contribution to the underlying infrastructure.\n",

    "summary": "This article compares Go, Rust, and Zig, not on features, but on the values and design philosophies each language embodies. The author experimented with each language to form an opinion on their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGo is characterized by its minimalism, aiming for simplicity and readability, even at the cost of boilerplate code. It's described as \"a modern C\" and is designed for corporate collaboration, prioritizing stability and ease of understanding, even in concurrent code. Go sacrifices complex features for simplicity and ease of use.\n\nRust, in contrast, embraces maximalism, aiming for \"zero-cost abstractions\" but with a high degree of complexity. Its primary goals are safety (memory safety and freedom from undefined behavior) and performance. Rust achieves safety through a complex type system and compile-time checks, requiring developers to be explicit about the intended behavior of their code. The language's complexity is a direct consequence of its commitment to these safety and performance guarantees.\n\nZig is presented as a reaction to both Go and Rust, offering more control and freedom to the programmer. It emphasizes manual memory management and data-oriented design, encouraging developers to manage memory in larger chunks rather than tying allocations to individual objects. Zig prioritizes control and direct manipulation of memory. The article concludes that Zig is not just about simplicity, but about fundamentally rethinking object-oriented programming and promoting a different approach to software design.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文比较了 Go、Rust 和 Zig 三种语言，不是比较其功能，而是比较每种语言所体现的价值观和设计理念。作者通过对每种语言的实践，形成了对其优缺点的看法。\n\nGo 的特点是极简主义，追求简洁性和可读性，即使以样板代码为代价。它被描述为“现代 C”，专为企业协作而设计，优先考虑稳定性和易于理解，即使在并发代码中也是如此。Go 牺牲了复杂的功能，以换取简单性和易用性。\n\n相比之下，Rust 拥抱的是最大化主义，旨在实现“零成本抽象”，但具有很高的复杂性。其主要目标是安全（内存安全和避免未定义行为）和性能。Rust 通过复杂的类型系统和编译时检查来实现安全，要求开发者明确代码的预期行为。语言的复杂性是其对这些安全和性能保证的直接结果。\n\nZig 被认为是 Go 和 Rust 的一种反思，为程序员提供了更多的控制权和自由度。它强调手动内存管理和面向数据的设计，鼓励开发者以更大的块来管理内存，而不是将分配与单个对象绑定。Zig 优先考虑控制权和对内存的直接操作。文章总结说，Zig 不仅仅是关于简单性，而是关于从根本上重新思考面向对象编程，并推广一种不同的软件设计方法。"

    "summary": "This article argues that Oracle should relinquish the JavaScript trademark, claiming it has been effectively abandoned due to non-use and becoming a generic term. The author contends that despite Oracle holding the trademark since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2009, Oracle has not meaningfully used the trademark in connection with a specific product, failing the \"use it or lose it\" principle of trademark law. While Oracle's GraalVM and JET utilize JavaScript, these uses are deemed insufficient to constitute genuine trademark use.\n\nFurthermore, the article asserts that JavaScript has become a generic term, evidenced by its widespread usage across the industry independent of Oracle. This genericization is highlighted by the fact that the standardized language specification is called ECMAScript, due to Oracle's refusal to release the \"JavaScript\" name to the standards body. The author points out the absurdity that community organizations and even conferences related to JavaScript must avoid using the language's name to avoid potential legal challenges.\n\nThe article urges Oracle to voluntarily release the trademark into the public domain. Failing that, the authors plan to file a petition for cancellation with the USPTO and are soliciting legal assistance. They also encourage readers to sign an open letter to show support for their cause. The core message is that the trademark is causing unnecessary confusion and disruption, and the time has come for JavaScript to be recognized as a generic term.\n",

    "summary": "This article explains how to effectively use \"stacked diffs\" (or stacked PRs) with Git, focusing on the `git rebase --onto` command. Stacked diffs involve breaking a large feature into smaller, dependent PRs, improving review speed and quality.\n\nThe core problem addressed is how to keep dependent branches synchronized when the base branch (e.g., `main` or a parent feature branch) is updated.  A regular `git rebase` can lead to duplicated commits and conflicts in downstream branches.\n\n`git rebase --onto` solves this by allowing precise control over which commits are moved and where they're placed. The article provides a step-by-step guide using a \"marker branch\" (e.g., `feature-2-base`) to track the original base of a dependent branch. The process involves:\n\n1.  Rebasing the base branch (e.g., `feature-1`) onto `main`.\n2.  Using `git rebase --onto feature-1 feature-2-base feature-2` to replay only the commits on `feature-2` that come *after* the `feature-2-base` onto the newly rebased `feature-1`.\n3.  Updating the marker branch (`git branch -f feature-2-base feature-1`) to point to the updated base branch. This is crucial for subsequent syncs.\n\nThe article also covers cleaning up a feature branch's history after its base branch has been merged into main using interactive rebase (`git rebase -i main`) to remove unnecessary commits. It concludes by acknowledging the added complexity of stacked diffs but argues that the benefits of smaller, easier-to-review PRs outweigh the overhead when done correctly, emphasizing the importance of maintaining marker branches and limiting the depth of the stack. The command `git push --force-with-lease` will be used often with this workflow.\n",

Valve has been quietly funding open-source projects like Proton and Fex, the latter of which they initiated, to create a compatibility layer that bridges the gap between x86-based Windows games and the Arm architecture.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to break down barriers for both users and developers, making PC gaming more accessible across a wider range of devices, including lower-power, Arm-based options that may be competitive with x86.  Valve sees potential in Arm-based SteamOS devices, including ultraportables, laptops, and even desktops.\n\nProton, based on Wine, allows Windows games to run on Linux by translating API calls. Fex then emulates x86 code on Arm, translating it \"just in time\" for near-native performance.  Valve emphasizes that this approach prioritizes game developers' time, allowing them to focus on improving their games rather than porting them to different architectures. While Valve doesn't have a specific plan to attract companies to build Arm SteamOS devices, they believe the technologies they are developing will \"grease the wheels\" and make it easier over time.\n",

    "summary": "This article details the key differences between IndyCar and Formula 1 cars, highlighting the areas where they diverge in design, technology, and philosophy. While both are open-wheel, formula racing series, F1 prioritizes technological innovation and maximizing performance at the limit, whereas IndyCar emphasizes driver skill and robustness, especially for oval tracks.\n\nKey differences include:\n\n*   **Chassis:** F1 teams design and build their own chassis, while IndyCar uses a standardized Dallara chassis.\n*   **Downforce:** F1 cars generate significantly more downforce overall, allowing for faster cornering speeds, while IndyCar focuses on underbody downforce to promote closer racing and relies more on driver skill.\n*   **Engines:** Both use hybrid turbo engines, but F1 engines are more powerful (800-850hp vs. 650-700hp), have higher RPM limits, and utilize a higher turbo boost.\n*   **Tires:** F1 uses softer Pirelli tires for maximum grip and speed, while IndyCar employs harder Firestone tires prioritizing durability, particularly important on ovals.\n*   **Weight:** IndyCars are heavier than F1 cars due to their more robust construction and the use of an aeroscreen.\n*   **Brakes:** F1 brakes are designed for maximum performance and are frequently replaced, while IndyCar brakes are more durable but less effective.\n*   **Development:** F1 allows for extensive team development, resulting in significant performance gains throughout a season. IndyCar has limited development opportunities, focusing primarily on dampers.\n\nConsequently, F1 cars are significantly faster on road courses, as demonstrated by historical lap time comparisons. The focus on driver skill, robustness, and closer racing in IndyCar contrasts with F1's emphasis on pushing technological boundaries.\n",

The author, Preston Byrne, reveals that Ofcom sent another letter to 4chan, a US company, asserting extraterritorial power to enforce UK censorship laws against Americans.\n\nByrne highlights that this latest letter follows 4chan's refusal to pay fines to the UK government. He includes a post from The Lunduke Journal on X (formerly Twitter) summarizing the situation, noting Ofcom's threat to expand its investigation into 4chan.\n\nByrne responds with a letter emphasizing the First Amendment protections afforded to 4chan and criticizing Ofcom's \"age assurance\" rules, which he claims would destroy online anonymity. He also mentions the potential enactment of a federal version of the GRANITE Act, a foreign censorship shield law reform proposal, inspired by Ofcom's previous actions.\n\nHe states 4chan will not cooperate with Ofcom on censorship matters and that it will instead focus on cooperating with law enforcement, including UK law enforcement, on child safety matters. He asserts that 4chan is not subject to Ofcom's jurisdiction and reiterates his stance that the British Army would need to invade the United States to enforce UK laws on American soil.\n\nByrne expresses hope that the US Congress and the White House will act to protect American entities from foreign overreach, suggesting the potential for a future where such notices from foreign governments are impossible to send to American citizens. He concludes by sharing the full letter from Ofcom.\n",

    "summary": "Luis Garicano's article delves into the EU's remarkable legislative productivity, contrasting it with the expected gridlock given its grand coalition structure. Despite encompassing diverse interests and requiring double hurdles for legislation, the EU passes an impressive number of laws.\n\nThe key lies in incentives: every actor benefits from producing legislation rather than blocking it. The Commission, lacking avenues for policy through spending, sees legislation as its primary means of influence, expanding competences, staff, and budgets.\n\nThe article highlights the crucial role of \"trilogues\" - informal negotiations between the Parliament, Council, and Commission. These private meetings, led by the Commission as the \"pen-holder,\" enable rapid compromise but can lead to drafting errors and exclude dissenting voices.\n\nThe European Parliament, while accountable to voters, is largely influenced by specialized committees. These committees, driven by specific ideological agendas, empower a small group of rapporteurs to negotiate laws with limited input from the broader Parliament. This can lead to significant policy changes driven by narrow majorities.\n\nThe Council, representing member states, is often pressured by the rotating Presidency to quickly close deals, even at the expense of ideal concessions. The Commission strategically delays proposals until favorable presidencies and exploits the six-month rotation.\n\nFinally, the increasing reliance on staff, accelerated by COVID-19, further empowers the permanent secretariats and weakens corridor conversations that are essential for building a coalition. This process is, despite its efficiency, generating low-quality legislation with overlaps and contradictions, and without impact assessments. Thus, the EU system prioritizes quantity over quality.\n",

    "summary": "This article presents a functional approach to building Quadtrees in Clojure/Clojurescript, contrasting it with more common imperative methods. Quadtrees are a tree data structure used to focus detail on certain data regions while conserving resources in others. The author emphasizes a declarative, easily rebuildable tree structure optimized for real-time visualization.\n\nThe key functional approach involves:\n\n1.  Reading a camera position (focus point).\n2.  Checking if the current node is optimally sized based on distance to the camera.\n3.  If not, splitting the node into four children and repeating step 2 recursively.\n\nThe author uses Clojure's `prewalk` function to implement this recursion in a concise manner. The visualization is built on a canvas element, updating as the Quadtree changes, which is implemented via atoms and watches. To avoid flickering, the color of each rectangle is determined by a hash of its center coordinates, ensuring color consistency. The author also provides examples of using prewalk and postwalk functions.\n\nThe article concludes by highlighting the benefits of Quadtrees for resource management, particularly in scenarios like VR where focus areas require high resolution. It praises Clojurescript for its expressiveness and functional capabilities, and Shadow-cljs for its ease of deployment and testing. Source code is available on Github.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the contrast between analytical integration (solving integrals using mathematical techniques) and numerical approximation via computer programs. The author, lacking advanced analytical skills, advocates for using computational methods for approximating integrals, especially when an exact solution isn't crucial.\n\nThe core idea is that integration can be viewed as summing the areas of many tiny rectangles under a curve. This can be approximated by generating random points within the integration range, evaluating the function at those points, and averaging the results. The author provides a simple JavaScript function to demonstrate this.\n\nThe article highlights a technique called \"sample unit engineering\" where the integration interval is split into sub-intervals, and samples are strategically allocated to regions where the function is more complex, such as near singularities. This significantly improves accuracy without increasing the overall sample size.\n\nThe author also discusses how to estimate the error in the approximation using statistical methods, specifically calculating a confidence interval based on the standard error of the mean. This allows for determining the reliability of the result, even without knowing the analytical solution.  Examples are provided comparing computer approximations to known integral values, showing that computers provide fairly accurate estimations with minimal code.\n\nWhile acknowledging the limitations of numerical solutions in certain scientific domains where functional solutions are needed, the author concludes that for many practical cases, a computer's approximation is sufficient and far more efficient than manual integration. They demonstrate that strategic allocation of samples results in better accuracy than naively increasing the sample size.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了解析积分（使用数学技巧求解积分）和通过计算机程序进行数值逼近之间的对比。作者缺乏高级解析技巧，因此提倡使用计算方法来逼近积分，尤其是在不需要精确解的情况下。\n\n核心思想是将积分视为对曲线下许多微小矩形面积的求和。这可以通过在积分范围内生成随机点，评估这些点上的函数值，并对结果求平均值来进行近似。作者提供了一个简单的JavaScript函数来演示这一点。\n\n本文重点介绍了一种称为“样本单元工程”的技术，其中积分区间被分割成子区间，并且样本被策略性地分配到函数更复杂的区域，例如奇点附近。这在不增加总样本量的情况下显著提高了准确性。\n\n作者还讨论了如何使用统计方法估算近似值中的误差，特别是基于均值的标准误差计算置信区间。这允许确定结果的可靠性，即使不知道解析解。文章提供了将计算机近似值与已知积分值进行比较的示例，表明计算机以最少的代码提供了相当准确的估计。\n\n虽然承认数值解在某些需要函数解的科学领域中存在局限性，但作者的结论是，对于许多实际情况，计算机的近似值是充分的，并且比手动积分效率高得多。他们证明，样本的策略性分配比天真地增加样本量能够获得更好的准确性。"

    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/12/microsoft-slashes-ai-sales-growth-targets-as-customers-resist-unproven-agents/",
    "summary": "Microsoft has significantly lowered its AI sales growth targets after salespeople failed to meet quotas for AI agent products like Foundry. These AI agents, designed for autonomous, multi-step tasks, were a central part of Microsoft's sales pitch, promising to automate complex business processes. However, enterprises have been hesitant to pay premium prices, and some employees prefer using tools like ChatGPT over Microsoft's Copilot, even when Copilot is available.\n\nThe article suggests that a key issue is the current limitations of AI agent technology. These systems, while improved, are still prone to \"confabulation,\" or generating false information, making them unreliable for high-stakes business tasks. Their brittleness, stemming from the underlying AI models' pattern-matching limitations, causes them to struggle with novel situations, potentially leading to costly mistakes. The promise of artificial general intelligence (AGI) addresses this, as it would enable AI to learn and perform new tasks without extensive prior training.\n\nDespite these challenges, Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, with record capital expenditures reported. However, much of its AI revenue comes from AI companies renting cloud infrastructure, not from traditional enterprises directly using its AI tools. This indicates a potential disconnect between Microsoft's AI ambitions and the current adoption rate by businesses. The article raises concerns about a potential AI bubble, with Microsoft building infrastructure for a revolution that many enterprises aren't yet ready for.\n",
    "chinese_title": "微软因销售人员未完成指标而将人工智能销售目标削减一半。",
    "chinese_summary": "微软大幅下调AI销售增长目标，原因是销售人员未能完成 Foundry 等 AI 代理产品的销售配额。这些 AI 代理旨在执行自主、多步骤任务，曾是微软销售策略的核心，承诺能自动化复杂的业务流程。然而，企业不愿支付高价，并且即使 Copilot 可用，一些员工也更喜欢使用 ChatGPT 等工具。\n\n文章指出，一个关键问题是当前 AI 代理技术的局限性。这些系统虽然有所改进，但仍然容易“虚构”或生成虚假信息，使其在关键业务任务中不可靠。它们的脆弱性源于底层 AI 模型的模式匹配限制，导致它们难以应对新情况，可能导致代价高昂的错误。通用人工智能 (AGI) 的前景解决了这个问题，因为它将使 AI 能够在没有大量先前培训的情况下学习和执行新任务。\n\n尽管面临这些挑战，微软仍在继续大力投资 AI 基础设施，报告称资本支出创历史新高。然而，其大部分 AI 收入来自 AI 公司租赁云基础设施，而不是来自传统企业直接使用其 AI 工具。这表明微软的 AI 野心与企业目前的采用率之间可能存在脱节。文章引发了人们对潜在 AI 泡沫的担忧，微软正在为一场许多企业尚未准备好的革命建设基础设施。"

    "url": "https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html",
    "summary": "Due to the high demand and inflated prices of RAM caused by the \"AI\" boom, Samsung Semiconductor is prioritizing data center suppliers over its own subsidiaries, like Samsung Electronics' Mobile Experience division. This means Samsung Semiconductor rejected Samsung Electronics' initial request for DRAM chips for its upcoming smartphones, forcing the phone-making division to renegotiate for a short-term deal at higher prices. This internal conflict highlights the severity of the RAM shortage and its impact on the electronics industry.\n\nThe article emphasizes that consumer electronics, particularly Samsung phones, are likely to experience price increases due to these higher memory costs. This trend isn't limited to Samsung, as other companies like Raspberry Pi and Lenovo are also grappling with rising RAM prices, with Lenovo even resorting to stockpiling memory.\n\nA forecast from TeamGroup suggests that this price surge is expected to continue well into 2027, with component prices having tripled recently. The article underscores the difficulties consumers will face in procuring affordable electronics amidst this \"chipflation\" crisis driven by the booming AI sector.\n",
    "chinese_title": "内存太贵了，三星都不卖给三星自己。",
    "chinese_summary": "由于“人工智能”热潮导致内存需求高涨、价格虚高，三星半导体公司优先供应数据中心供应商，而非其自身子公司，如三星电子的移动体验部门。 这意味着三星半导体拒绝了三星电子最初为其即将推出的智能手机提出的DRAM芯片需求，迫使手机制造部门以更高的价格重新谈判短期协议。 这种内部冲突突显了内存短缺的严重性及其对电子行业的影响。\n\n文章强调，由于内存成本上涨，消费电子产品，特别是三星手机，很可能面临价格上涨。 这种趋势不仅限于三星，包括树莓派和联想在内的其他公司也在努力应对不断上涨的内存价格，联想甚至开始囤积内存。\n\nTeamGroup的预测表明，这种价格飙升预计将持续到2027年，近期组件价格已经上涨了两倍。 文章强调，在这种由蓬勃发展的人工智能行业驱动的“芯片通胀”危机中，消费者在采购价格合理的电子产品方面将面临困难。"

    "url": "https://nnethercote.github.io/2025/12/05/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-december-2025.html",
    "summary": "This article summarizes Rust compiler performance improvements in the latter half of 2025, covering various contributions and their impact. Several PRs are highlighted for their performance gains, including optimizations to `VecCache`, trivial const lowering (particularly beneficial for the `libc` crate), removing unnecessary computation in debug code, and improving temporary scope handling. An LLVM update also contributed to performance improvements, although with mixed results regarding wall-time.\n\nThe author details significant proc macro optimizations in the Bevy game engine, achieved by using the `-Zmacro-stats` flag to identify and eliminate redundant code generated by `#[derive(Reflect)]`. This led to substantial reductions in generated code size, compilation time, and memory usage.\n\nImprovements to `rustdoc-json` are also discussed, specifically reducing allocations, though the author suggests a need for a performance-oriented alternative format to cater to heavy-duty tools like `cargo-semver-checks`. Josh Triplett's experimental flag `-Zhint-mostly-unused` is mentioned as a potential compile-time win for large API crates with limited usage. The article also notes the unexpected finding that a secret MacOS setting can speed up Rust builds.\n\nOverall, the article reports modest wall-time improvements in Rust compiler performance, despite mixed results in other metrics. The author emphasizes that maintaining or slightly improving compiler speed is a victory given the constant influx of new features and bug fixes that often negatively impact performance. The author also highlights the significant performance boost gained from upgrading hardware.\n",
    "chinese_title": "2025年12月如何加速Rust编译器",
    "chinese_summary": "本文总结了 2025 年下半年 Rust 编译器性能的改进，涵盖了各种贡献及其影响。重点介绍了几个 PR 的性能提升，包括对 `VecCache` 的优化、平凡常量降级（尤其有利于 `libc` crate）、移除调试代码中不必要的计算，以及改进临时作用域处理。LLVM 更新也为性能改进做出了贡献，尽管在实际耗时方面结果不一。\n\n作者详细介绍了 Bevy 游戏引擎中显著的 proc macro 优化，这是通过使用 `-Zmacro-stats` 标志来识别和消除 `#[derive(Reflect)]` 生成的冗余代码来实现的。这导致了生成的代码大小、编译时间和内存使用量的显著减少。\n\n文章还讨论了 `rustdoc-json` 的改进，特别是减少了内存分配，但作者认为需要一种面向性能的替代格式，以满足像 `cargo-semver-checks` 这样的重型工具的需求。Josh Triplett 的实验性标志 `-Zhint-mostly-unused` 被提及为大型 API crate 在使用受限情况下的潜在编译时胜利。文章还指出，一个秘密的 MacOS 设置可以加速 Rust 构建，这是一个意想不到的发现。\n\n总而言之，尽管在其他指标上结果不一，但本文报告了 Rust 编译器性能在实际耗时方面略有改进。作者强调，考虑到不断涌入的新特性和 bug 修复通常会对性能产生负面影响，保持或略微提高编译器速度就是一种胜利。作者还强调了升级硬件带来的显著性能提升。"
