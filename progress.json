    "summary": "In a significant breakthrough, Google DeepMind's advanced version of Gemini Deep Think achieved gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2025, solving five out of six problems perfectly and earning 35 total points. This surpasses their previous silver-medal achievement in 2024 with AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2.\n\nUnlike the previous year's model, which required translation between natural language and formal languages and several days of computation, Gemini Deep Think operated end-to-end in natural language within the 4.5-hour competition time limit, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from problem descriptions.\n\nThe success is attributed to \"Deep Think\" mode, an enhanced reasoning mode employing parallel thinking, combined with reinforcement learning techniques and training on high-quality mathematics solutions and IMO tips.  IMO President Prof. Dr. Gregor Dolinar confirmed the gold-medal score, praising the clarity and precision of the solutions.\n\nGoogle DeepMind plans to make a version of this Deep Think model available to trusted testers before rolling it out to Google AI Ultra subscribers.  They also continue to develop their formal systems, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof, with the aim of creating AI agents that combine natural language fluency with rigorous reasoning. Google DeepMind anticipates that these AI systems will become invaluable tools for advancing human knowledge across various fields. The company thanked the IMO, the large team of engineers, researchers, and mathematicians who contributed to this achievement.\n",

    "summary": "This Volts podcast episode features a conversation with Kostantsa Rangelova and Dave Jones of Ember about their new report on the declining costs of solar+storage. The report finds that in sunny cities, solar+storage can now provide baseload power for less than the cost of new nuclear or even new gas.\n\nThe discussion highlights the rapid advancements and cost reductions in battery technology, particularly a 40% price drop in the last year alone. They explain how combining solar and storage allows for maximizing grid connection utilization by flattening the electricity generation curve, enabling 24/7 power output and displacing fossil fuel generation at all hours.\n\nThe podcast also explores real-world examples, such as a 1 GW 24/7 solar+storage project in the UAE and a solar+battery-powered tourist village in Saudi Arabia. The speakers discuss the shift towards LFP batteries, which are cheaper, cobalt-free, and have longer lifecycles, as well as the potential of sodium-ion batteries. Despite the land footprint concerns, the falling prices of both solar and storage are making this combination increasingly competitive. The main takeaway is that the economics of solar+storage have drastically improved, and even energy professionals need to catch up with the current reality.\n",

The triple product, a key metric for fusion energy generation, measures how close a device is to achieving net energy production. Wendelstein 7-X sustained a peak value of this parameter for 43 seconds during its recent OP 2.3 campaign, surpassing previous records held by tokamak devices like JT-60U and JET for long pulse durations.\n\nThis achievement signifies a crucial step towards developing a power-plant-capable stellarator, bringing the triple product to tokamak levels during sustained plasma pulses. The success was attributed to international collaboration between the Wendelstein 7-X team, EUROfusion, and partners from the United States. Notably, a pellet injector from Oak Ridge National Laboratory enabled the long plasma durations by supplying a steady stream of hydrogen particles. Contributions from other European and American labs provided essential diagnostics for measuring the triple product's contributing factors.\n\nIn addition to the triple product record, the campaign also achieved milestones in energy turnover and plasma pressure relative to magnetic pressure. These accomplishments validate the stellarator concept and showcase the significance of international collaboration in advancing fusion energy research.\n",

    "summary": "TrackWeight is a macOS application that transforms a MacBook's Force Touch trackpad into a digital weighing scale. It leverages the Open Multi-Touch Support library to access raw pressure data from the trackpad, which is normally inaccessible. The application calibrates the pressure readings against a traditional scale, converting them into weight measurements, and surprisingly, the raw data is already in grams.\n\nTo use TrackWeight, the user opens the application, places a finger on the trackpad, and then rests the object to be weighed on the trackpad while maintaining finger contact. This contact is crucial because the trackpad only registers pressure when a conductive object (like a finger) is detected.\n\nRequirements for running TrackWeight include macOS 13.0+, a MacBook with a Force Touch trackpad (2015+ MacBook Pro, 2016+ MacBook), a disabled App Sandbox, and Xcode 16.0+ with Swift 6.0+. The installation process involves cloning the repository, opening the project in Xcode, disabling the App Sandbox, and building the application.\n\nThe application has limitations: it requires finger contact during weighing, objects must not interfere with finger contact, and metal objects may need insulation to avoid misidentification as finger touch. TrackWeight utilizes SwiftUI for the interface, Combine for data flow, and the Open Multi-Touch Support library for trackpad access.\n\nThe author emphasizes that TrackWeight is for experimental and educational purposes only and should not be used for critical measurements. Accuracy should always be verified with a calibrated scale for important applications.\n",

While LLMs are showing promise in understanding and generating human-like text, their application to accounting faces significant challenges due to the inherent requirements of accuracy, reliability, and explainability.\n\nThe article highlights LLMs' strengths in processing unstructured data (e.g., invoices, receipts), potentially automating data extraction and categorization. They could also assist with tasks like drafting financial reports or summarizing complex accounting regulations.\n\nHowever, the article emphasizes crucial limitations. Accounting relies on precise calculations and logical reasoning, areas where LLMs can struggle. LLMs are prone to \"hallucinations,\" generating incorrect or fabricated information, which is unacceptable in a field demanding meticulous accuracy. Furthermore, accounting requires adherence to strict rules and regulations, and LLMs' inability to consistently apply these rules poses a major hurdle.\n\nThe article suggests that while LLMs can augment certain accounting workflows, they are unlikely to fully replace human accountants in the near future. The need for explainability and auditability in accounting necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying logic, something LLMs currently lack. The most promising applications involve using LLMs to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up accountants to focus on more complex analytical and strategic work. The author concludes that a hybrid approach, combining human expertise with LLM capabilities, is the most likely path forward.\n",

    "summary": "SecretSpec is introduced as a declarative secrets management tool designed to address the shortcomings of traditional `.env` file-based approaches. The problems with `.env` include lack of clear application-secret contracts, parsing ambiguity, difficult password manager integration, vendor lock-in, and lack of encryption. Existing alternatives like encrypted `.env` files or Vault introduce complexity regarding key management, trust requirements, and operational overhead.\n\nSecretSpec tackles this by separating secret management into three key concerns: **WHAT** secrets are needed, **HOW** they are required (e.g., required, optional, defaults, validation), and **WHERE** they are stored. This allows applications to declare their secret needs in a `secretspec.toml` file, while different environments (development, CI/CD, production) can use their preferred secret storage providers (keychain, environment variables, AWS Secrets Manager) without modifying application code.\n\nThe article demonstrates the usage of SecretSpec in different environments using a shared `secretspec.toml` file and various secret providers. Furthermore, it presents a Rust SDK that offers type-safe access to secrets and compile-time guarantees, ensuring that the application only knows *what* secrets it needs, not *where* they come from. SecretSpec promotes clean, portable application logic. The authors encourage the development of similar SDKs for other languages and hint at future features like secret rotation and generation.\n",

    "summary": "This article details how the authors made Postgres writes faster using a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree in their `pg_search` extension, but encountered replication issues, specifically with physical replication.\n\nStandard Postgres uses B-tree or GIN indexes, which are not optimized for high-volume writes. LSM trees, designed for faster writes, store incoming data in memory and then flush it to disk in sorted segments. However, this approach revealed limitations with Postgres' Write-Ahead Log (WAL) based physical replication.\n\nThe authors explain that replication safety requires both physical (structurally valid data) and logical consistency (data reflects a coherent view). Atomicity is crucial for physical consistency because locks aren't replayed on replicas. Multi-node operations require techniques like Copy-on-Write to avoid data corruption without global locks on replicas.\n\nA major challenge arose with VACUUM operations, which remove \"dead\" tuples flagged by Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). Compactions in LSM trees, similar to VACUUMs, increased the frequency of conflicts where replicas could access data being cleaned up on the primary.\n\nThe solution was leveraging the `hot_standby_feedback` Postgres setting. This allows the replica to inform the primary of the oldest transaction ID (xmin) still in use, enabling the primary to defer cleanup operations and avoid premature VACUUMs. While `hot_standby_feedback` is helpful, the authors highlight the challenges of guaranteeing replication safety in a distributed Postgres system. They conclude that their approach of an atomically logged LSM tree with `hot_standby_feedback` provides the fastest search performance without sacrificing consistency.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "本文详细介绍了作者如何在他们的`pg_search`扩展中使用日志结构合并树（LSM树）来加速Postgres写入，但遇到了复制问题，特别是物理复制方面的问题。\n\n标准的Postgres使用B树或GIN索引，它们并未针对高容量写入进行优化。专为更快写入设计的LSM树将传入的数据存储在内存中，然后将其以排序的段刷新到磁盘。然而，这种方法揭示了Postgres基于预写日志（WAL）的物理复制的局限性。\n\n作者解释说，复制安全性需要物理一致性（结构上有效的数据）和逻辑一致性（数据反映了一个连贯的视图）。原子性对于物理一致性至关重要，因为锁不会在副本上重放。多节点操作需要像写时复制这样的技术，以避免在没有副本全局锁的情况下发生数据损坏。\n\n一个主要的挑战出现在VACUUM操作中，该操作会删除多版本并发控制（MVCC）标记为“死亡”的元组。LSM树中的压缩与VACUUM类似，增加了冲突的频率，副本可能访问主数据库上正在清理的数据。\n\n解决方案是利用`hot_standby_feedback`这个Postgres设置。 这允许副本通知主数据库仍在使用的最旧的事务ID（xmin），从而使主数据库能够推迟清理操作并避免过早的VACUUM。 虽然`hot_standby_feedback`很有帮助，但作者强调了在分布式Postgres系统中保证复制安全性的挑战。 他们得出结论，他们使用原子记录的LSM树和`hot_standby_feedback`的方法提供了最快的搜索性能，而不会牺牲一致性。"

The core idea leverages the immense number of possible card arrangements (52!), which translates to roughly 225 bits of potential data storage.\n\nThe article explains how to achieve this by using Lehmer codes to represent each unique card permutation numerically. The Lehmer code is then converted into a factorial number, which can be easily transformed into a single, large decimal number representing the encoded message. This process maps the card order to a specific numerical value within the 225-bit range.\n\nTo make this usable, the author proposes a 5-bit character set including letters, space, and a few punctuation marks, allowing for encoding up to 45 characters. The blog provides Python code snippets for converting between decimal numbers, factoradic representations, permutations, and the chosen character set. This code facilitates both encoding text into a card arrangement and decoding it back.\n\nThe post emphasizes that the encoding/decoding works due to the reversibility of each step in the process. The author also notes an interesting characteristic of the Lehmer code: changing a card affects subsequent characters in the decoded message but leaves previous ones untouched. A web application, implemented in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly for browser-based performance, is provided, allowing users to try the technique themselves, including an optional XOR cipher for added \"encryption\".\n",

    "summary": "This article clarifies the meaning of \"dynamic programming\" in computer science, arguing that the confusion stems from misunderstanding the word \"programming\" in this context. It's not about computer programming (writing code) but rather about \"planning\" or \"scheduling,\" similar to \"TV programming\" or the planning stages of civil engineering projects.\n\nThe article illustrates this with an example of building construction, where steps must be ordered and dependencies respected (e.g., the foundation must be laid before the structure). Similarly, dynamic programming involves planning the order of sub-problems to solve a larger problem, ensuring dependencies are met and redundant computations are avoided (as demonstrated with the Fibonacci sequence example). This \"program\" can be built top-down or bottom-up.\n\nThe article concludes by explaining the historical origin of the term, coined by Richard Bellman. He chose \"dynamic programming\" partly to avoid scrutiny from a Secretary of Defense who disliked the word \"research,\" selecting a term that sounded less threatening and scientific while also accurately describing the multi-stage, time-varying nature of the problem-solving approach. The term \"dynamic\" was chosen because it was difficult to use in a pejorative way, making it politically safe.\n",

    "summary": "In July 2025, the Indian Parliament's Select Committee tabled a report on the new Income Tax Bill 2025, retaining controversial provisions that grant tax officials broad powers to access citizens' social media and private emails during search and seizure operations. The bill aims to simplify and rationalize the existing Income Tax Act of 1961.\n\nThe new bill mandates individuals to provide tax officers with technical assistance, including access codes, to inspect electronically stored information on computer systems, social media accounts, online investment platforms, and other digital spaces. It even allows officials to bypass access codes if necessary.\n\nWhile stakeholders consulted by the Select Committee expressed concerns about these provisions, suggesting limitations on accessing social media and a focus on tax-related information only, the committee defended the measures. They argued that these powers are essential to uncover encrypted communications and unaccounted transactions often hidden within electronic records. The committee rejected suggestions to require tangible reasons for seeking access, deeming it unfeasible and potentially hindering the ability to prevent abuse of power and protect taxpayer privacy.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding these expanded search and seizure powers, the committee highlighted the bill's significant simplification of India's income tax legislation. The bill reduces the number of words, chapters, and sections while increasing the number of tables and formulae, aiming for greater clarity and ease of understanding.\n",

    "chinese_summary": "2025年7月，印度议会特别委员会提交了一份关于《2025年新所得税法案》的报告，其中保留了备受争议的条款，这些条款赋予税务官员广泛的权力，可以在搜查和扣押行动中访问公民的社交媒体和私人电子邮件。该法案旨在简化和合理化现行的1961年《所得税法》。\n\n新法案强制要求个人向税务官员提供技术协助，包括访问代码，以检查计算机系统、社交媒体账户、在线投资平台和其他数字空间中存储的电子信息。它甚至允许官员在必要时绕过访问代码。\n\n尽管特别委员会咨询的利益相关者对这些条款表示担忧，建议限制访问社交媒体，并仅关注与税收相关的信息，但委员会为这些措施辩护。他们认为，这些权力对于发现加密通信和通常隐藏在电子记录中的未申报交易至关重要。委员会拒绝了要求提供寻求访问的实际理由的建议，认为这不可行，并可能阻碍防止滥用权力和保护纳税人隐私的能力。\n\n尽管这些扩大搜查和扣押权力的规定存在争议，但委员会强调了该法案对印度所得税立法的重大简化。该法案减少了字数、章节和条款数量，同时增加了表格和公式的数量，旨在提高清晰度和易于理解性。"

    "url": "https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202507/noti3192/noti3192.html",
    "summary": "This article provides an overview of the algebraic theory of quadratic forms, focusing on developments over the last four decades. It begins by tracing the historical roots of quadratic forms, from ancient civilizations to Gauss's work and the algebraic theory established by Witt and Pfister. The article then delves into modern approaches, emphasizing the interplay between algebraic geometry and quadratic form theory. A key technique involves associating a quadric hypersurface $X_q$ to a quadratic form $q$ and studying algebraic cycles on products of quadrics.\n\nThe article highlights the solution of the Milnor conjectures as a major achievement, linking the graded Witt ring to Galois cohomology via Milnor's K-theory.  It also discusses discrete invariants of fields defined by quadratic forms, such as the u-invariant and the Pythagoras number, outlining recent results and open questions. Furthermore, it touches upon the determination of splitting patterns for quadratic forms and introduces Chow motives as a visualization tool for indecomposable direct summands of quadrics. The article focuses on fields of characteristic different from 2.\n",

Pizan's account, informed by her father's role at court and consultation with royal staff, details the King's routine.\n\nThe day began early with prayer and lighthearted interaction with servants. Following mass, Charles addressed petitions from his subjects, demonstrating his accessibility and commitment to justice. He then attended short Royal Council meetings, possibly limited due to his health. His meals were simple, followed by music.\n\nAfternoons were spent receiving visitors, ambassadors, and officials, handling governance matters like signing letters and dispensing rewards. A short rest was followed by leisure activities such as viewing jewels and enjoying his gardens, where he interacted with family and courtiers.\n\nMichael Brauer's analysis emphasizes the significance of Charles's public appearances, reinforcing the image of a wise and just ruler. He highlights the three main social settings: public appearances, interactions with family/courtiers, and private time. Pizan's account portrays a balanced life, blending prayer, governance, and leisure. This structured routine was presented as a model for political life, reflecting the medieval emphasis on order and self-governance as essential for effective rule.\n",

    "title": "Writing your Clojure tests in EDN files",
    "url": "https://biffweb.com/p/edn-tests/",
    "summary": "This article describes a simplified approach to Clojure unit testing using EDN files. Instead of complex test runners, tests are defined as data in `.edn` files, resembling REPL interactions. Each test case contains an `:eval` key holding Clojure code to be executed.\n\nThe test runner executes the code in `:eval` and automatically adds a `:result` key with the evaluated output, then pretty-prints the entire test case back to the EDN file. There is no explicit \"passing\" or \"failing\" state. Changes in test results are detected via `git diff`, requiring developers to review and either commit expected changes or fix underlying bugs.\n\nThe author uses helper functions like `t/with-db` for common tasks like populating in-memory databases for tests. If the code in `:eval` throws an exception, the exception data (including a truncated stack trace) is recorded under the `:ex` key.  Furthermore, any values \"tapped\" (using Clojure's `tap>`) during execution are captured under the `:tapped` key, allowing for inspecting intermediate values.\n\nThe author provides a `run-examples!` function (available for copying) that locates and runs these tests. This function is integrated into a file watcher to automatically update test results on file saves, enabling a rapid feedback loop during development. The author prefers this approach for its simplicity and direct mapping to REPL-driven development.\n",

    "summary": "This article details how the Australian anti-pornography group, Collective Shout, claims responsibility for Steam's recent crackdown on sexually explicit games and stricter moderation guidelines. Valve cited pressure from payment processors as the reason for the changes, and Collective Shout says their campaign targeting these processors incited that pressure.\n\nThe group, known for its campaigns against content it deems objectifying or sexualizing, previously pressured retailers to stop selling Grand Theft Auto 5 and successfully prevented Tyler the Creator from touring Australia. They launched a campaign urging payment processors to cease working with Steam and itch.io due to the presence of games featuring \"rape, incest, and child-abuse.\"\n\nAfter what they reported as a letter writing campaign involving over 1,000 contacts to the payment processors Collective Shout claimed victory when Steam removed numerous games on July 15th. The article notes discrepancies in the numbers of removed games claimed by Collective Shout versus those identified on SteamDB.\n\nThe article also highlights the retraction of two related articles from Waypoint, allegedly due to concerns about their controversial content, and the subsequent resignation of the articles' author, Ana Valens, who stands by her reporting and urges further investigation into payment processor-based censorship. Valens claimed there was an obvious payment processor censorship being implemented on Steam, Itch.io and Patreon.

The core argument is that logging every X seconds (time-based) is more consistent and beneficial than logging every X messages (count-based).\n\nCount-based logging struggles to find a suitable value for \"X\" because event processing rates vary drastically between environments (e.g., production vs. testing). This can lead to either overwhelming log output at peak load, slowing down the system and increasing storage costs, or insufficient logs, hindering observability.\n\nTime-based logging, in contrast, provides a consistent log rate regardless of the processing speed. By logging the number of events processed within a specific time interval, it ensures sufficient logging to confirm the application's activity without flooding the system with redundant information. This approach balances observability with performance, making it a more practical solution for applications dealing with fluctuating event processing rates.

    "summary": "This article explores the possibility of experiencing new colors beyond the standard human color gamut without using invasive laser stimulation. The author begins by explaining how our eyes perceive color through overlapping cone cell sensitivities, limiting the range of colors we normally see. A research paper (Fong et al., 2025) selectively stimulated individual cone cells with lasers, reportedly leading to subjects seeing \"blue-green of unprecedented saturation.\"\n\nThe author then introduces an optical illusion as a potential method to achieve a similar effect. By staring at a shrinking red circle on a bluish-green background, the red circle saturates red-sensitive cones, allowing for a greater activation of green-sensitive cones and a perceived intense blue-green color.\n\nHowever, the author acknowledges that the range of colors that screens can display is limited by sRGB colorspace, which cannot reproduce all colors in the human gamut. As such, the illusions may not completely replicate the effects of direct cone stimulation. The author provides a tool for readers to experiment with different color combinations to explore the effects of this type of illusion. Finally, the author touches on the potential for these illusions to assist individuals with colorblindness and encourages readers to experiment and share their experiences.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores the historical significance of \"The Sumerian Game,\" a 1964 strategy computer game considered a precursor to modern city-building and empire management games. Historian Andrea Contato explains that the game, initially designed for American schoolchildren, simulated the challenges of ruling the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash, requiring players to manage resources and make crucial decisions with significant consequences.\n\nDespite its influence, \"The Sumerian Game\" was virtually unknown for decades until rediscovered through historical research. It is significant for several \"firsts,\" including being one of the earliest computer games, an early example of edutainment, and possibly the first multimedia game, combining printed output with slides and audio. Mabel Addis, the history teacher who collaborated on the game, is often credited as the first writer and game designer.\n\nWhile the original game and its source code are lost, Contato recreated several versions, available on Steam, to preserve its legacy. The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing the contributions of all individuals involved in its development, not just Mabel Addis. Contato hopes to commemorate the names of all those that developed \"The Sumerian Game.\"\n",

    "summary": "This article, \"Super-resolution microscopes reveal new details of cells and disease,\" explores how advanced light microscopy is revolutionizing our understanding of cell biology and disease. Super-resolution microscopes overcome the diffraction limit of traditional light microscopes, allowing scientists to visualize cellular structures and processes at a much finer scale (down to 10 nanometers). This is achieved through techniques like single-molecule localization microscopy, stimulated emission depletion, and structured illumination microscopy.\n\nThe enhanced resolution is enabling scientists to revise biology textbooks by revealing previously unseen cell structures. Examples include the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) in neurons, and the diverse protein compositions on the surfaces of lysosomes. Researchers are also studying the interactions between organelles, like mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, and how disruptions in these interactions may contribute to diseases like ALS.\n\nFurthermore, super-resolution microscopy provides new insights into the organization of DNA within the cell nucleus, revealing the variability of chromatin structures and their impact on gene expression. This has implications for understanding cell differentiation and stem cell biology.\n\nThe technology is also proving valuable in studying diseases like cancer and viral infections. It allows researchers to visualize proteins on cancer cell surfaces, enabling better targeting of therapies, and to observe the intricate processes by which viruses infect and replicate within cells, potentially leading to new antiviral strategies.  The ongoing refinements to super-resolution technology promise to further expand our understanding of the inner workings of cells.\n",

The man, Keith, entered the MRI room without permission while his wife was having a scan, and his heavy metallic necklace caused him to be violently drawn into the machine.\n\nAccording to police, the incident \"resulted in a medical episode,\" and Keith was pronounced dead at the scene. His wife, Adrienne Jones-McAllister, explained that she had asked him to enter the room to help her up after her knee scan. Keith was wearing a 20lb metal chain with a lock he used for weight training. She claims the machine immediately pulled him in, causing him to hit it.\n\nJones-McAllister stated that this was not their first visit to the facility and that an employee had previously seen the necklace. She also claimed the technician struggled to pull her husband away and that she pleaded for them to turn the machine off and call 911.\n\nMRI machines use powerful magnetic fields and patients are always instructed to remove metallic objects before entering the room to prevent them from becoming dangerous projectiles. The US Food and Drug Administration warns that metallic objects can be attracted to the machine and cause injury or damage.

    "url": "https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Perl/Version-Scheme",
    "summary": "This Gentoo Wiki article explains the challenges of Perl versioning and how Gentoo addresses them. Upstream Perl uses two version schemes, one of which (floating-point versions) is incompatible with Gentoo's integer-based version sorting. Floating-point versions treat `1.1` and `1.10` as equal, while v-versions (e.g., `v1.2`) are sorted as integer sequences. This leads to inconsistent sorting.\n\nGentoo's solution involves translating upstream Perl versions into a consistent scheme that preserves the original sorting order. This translation is implemented in `Gentoo::PerlMod::Version` and transforms \"floating\" versions into a \"v-Version\" format (without the \"v\"). This involves padding, splitting, and stripping zeros to create a minimum of three digit groups. For example, `1.1` becomes `1.100.0`, and `1.0001` becomes `1.0.100`.\n\nThe resulting Gentoo versions, when used with Perl's version comparison functions, behave the same as the original pre-normalized versions.  This avoids comparison inconsistencies and allows for predictable results. The article also mentions and criticizes competing normalization schemes that fail to retain comparison positions, highlighting the benefits of Gentoo's approach. The article emphasizes that by converting the floating-point version numbers to an integer sequence format, version comparisons will act predictably, and according to upstream's intention.\n",

The core idea is to combine different Large Language Models (LLMs) within a single agentic loop, leveraging their individual strengths. Instead of consistently using one LLM, the agent alternates between models (e.g., Gemini and Sonnet) during its iterative process, giving each model the opportunity to contribute to the solution based on its strengths.\n\nThis approach is particularly effective for tasks requiring multiple, distinct ideas to be combined, where each LLM might excel in different aspects. Ziegler observed that alloys perform best when the combined models are significantly different in their areas of expertise and when balanced toward the stronger individual model.\n\nHe contrasts alloyed agents with other approaches to combining model strengths: using different models for different tasks, having models vote on answers, or letting models debate with each other, arguing that these are too complex or computationally expensive for their use case.\n\nZiegler provides data showing that alloyed agents using combinations of models like Sonnet and Gemini outperform single-model agents. He also outlines scenarios where alloyed agents might not be suitable, such as when prompt caching is critical, the task requires steady progress rather than bursts of insight, or when models are too similar.\n",

    "summary": "This article explores how to simulate the \"boiling\" or \"line boil\" animation effect, commonly seen in cartoons, using SVG filters and JavaScript. The effect mimics hand-drawn animation by creating a subtle, dynamic wobble in static images.\n\nThe author breaks down the effect into two components: distorting edges to look less perfect and animating these distortions over time. They then detail how to achieve this using SVG filter primitives, specifically `feTurbulence` to generate noise and `feDisplacementMap` to use that noise to warp the image.\n\nThe article explains how `feTurbulence` creates a noise texture and `feDisplacementMap` uses it to offset the image pixels, resulting in a warping effect.  The core of the technique lies in animating the parameters of these filters using JavaScript. By updating attributes like `baseFrequency` at regular intervals, a dynamic distortion is created, simulating the boiling motion.\n\nInteractive demos are provided to illustrate the interplay of the filters and the impact of various parameters, such as animation scale and base frequency offset. The article concludes that by combining procedural noise, displacement mapping, and JavaScript-driven animation, static illustrations can be brought to life with a convincing hand-drawn aesthetic.

While these options offer some protection, they often lack specific error location and context. The author advocates for a custom logging approach to provide more informative debugging.\n\nThe core of the solution involves creating logging functions: `log::info` for general messages, `log::level_is_active` to control log verbosity based on a `LOG_LEVEL` variable, and `log::_write_log` for the actual writing. `log::_write_log` formats log messages with timestamps, filenames (extracted using parameter substitution on `BASH_SOURCE`), function names (`FUNCNAME`), and redirects output to stderr.\n\nThe author then introduces `log::error`, which extends the logging capabilities by including a stack trace. It iterates through `FUNCNAME` to capture the call stack, using `BASH_SOURCE` and `BASH_LINENO` to pinpoint the file and line number where the error occurred. The article showcases an example error log with a stack trace, demonstrating its utility in identifying the root cause of problems.\n\nFinally, the author suggests using a `trap` to automatically log errors and stack traces when a script exits with a non-zero status, ensuring comprehensive error reporting.

A specific example, \\(M(\\mu) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1+\\mu \\\\ 1-\\mu & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\), illustrates how the geometry of the plot reveals the nature of the eigenvalues (real or complex conjugate) based on the value of \\(\\mu\\).\n\nThe author then offers another example, \\(M(\\mu) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\mu \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\) leading to the equation \\(((y+zi)-1)^2=x\\). Splitting into real and imaginary components then yields a parabola in the \\(xz\\)-plane and a parabola in the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\nFinally, the article concludes by mentioning a Desmos calculator that can be used to create similar plots for other 2x2 matrices dependent on a single real parameter.\n",

Waclawiak recounts searching her mother's emails, hoping to find evidence that she had been truthful about the severity of her condition. Her mother, diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 28 years prior, rarely spoke openly about her disease, viewing illness as a source of humiliation stemming from her childhood experiences in postwar Poland, where her father's tuberculosis led to social isolation.\n\nThe essay explores her mother's difficult upbringing, marked by poverty and the desire to escape the limitations of Communist Poland. Waclawiak shares anecdotes about her family's emigration to America, their eventual return to Poland and Austria, and the refugee camp they resided in. Her mother found success as a consulting engineer in the US, embodying the immigrant dream of reinvention.\n\nDespite their close bond, Waclawiak grapples with the feeling that she didn't truly know her mother. Her mother's stoicism, born from a fear of vulnerability, prevented her from fully sharing her experiences and emotions. In her final days, her mother's personality changed after her heart stopped during surgery, becoming more aggressive and desperate. The essay culminates in Waclawiak's regret over her inability to confront the reality of her mother's impending death and her enduring sense of displacement and loss.\n",

    "summary": "Okay, here's a summary of the article based on the title and presumed context:\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is implementing a new policy limiting scientists to submitting a maximum of six grant applications per year. This decision is driven by concerns about the potential for a surge in applications generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. The NIH fears that AI could lead to a flood of grant proposals, overwhelming the review process and unfairly disadvantaging researchers who rely on traditional methods.\n\nThe new rule aims to prevent researchers from using AI to submit a large volume of applications, thereby increasing their chances of funding through sheer numbers rather than the quality of individual proposals. The agency hopes that the limitation will encourage researchers to focus on crafting higher-quality, more competitive proposals rather than relying on AI to generate quantity.\n\nWhile the NIH acknowledges the potential benefits of AI in research, they are also aware of the risks of using it for automated grant writing. This policy is a proactive measure designed to maintain the integrity and fairness of the grant review process, ensuring that funding decisions are based on scientific merit and innovation, not on the ability to generate a high volume of applications. The long-term impact of the policy on research funding and the adoption of AI tools in scientific writing remains to be seen.\n",

It prioritizes ease of compilation and deployment, requiring only a C compiler and standard C runtime libraries. Compilation instructions, including optimizations for performance and size, are provided.\n\nSIOF adheres to Scheme principles, featuring a precise garbage collector, tail recursion, `call/cc`, dynamic-wind, multiple return values, and a hygienic macro system. While mostly R7RS-small compatible, it has limitations like fixed-precision numbers (30-bit fixnums, doubles for flonums), no bignum/rational/complex support, and limited Unicode support. Several R7RS-small features are simplified or not fully implemented.\n\nThe REPL supports circular structures (though `eval` and `load` reject them), provides all R7RS-small forms in the built-in library, and dynamically loads libraries from .sld files. The `-L` command-line option extends the library search path. The `features` procedure returns a list including `r7rs`, `exact-closed`, `siof`, and the SIOF version. Interaction environment exposes all R7RS-small procedures and syntax forms directly, removing the need for import in simple cases.\n\nSIOF's origins are in the #F language, with its compiler derived from Marc Feeley's Scheme Interpreter and its macroexpander from Al Petrofsky's alexpander. S4IOF and S5IOF are related projects, offering smaller systems without macros and an R5RS-compatible variant, respectively.\n",

A recent patch claims a \"100x speedup\" for the 'rangedetect8_avx512' function. While the developers clarified that this dramatic improvement applies to a single, obscure filter and not the entirety of FFmpeg, users with modern processors supporting AVX512 should see the full benefit, while others will see a smaller uplift.\n\nThe article highlights the ongoing relevance of hand-optimized assembly code, contrasting it with compiler-generated code. This practice, prevalent in older computing eras with limited resources, continues to offer substantial performance gains in specific situations. The FFmpeg team even runs a \"school\" dedicated to assembly language.\n\nHowever, the comments section reveals nuance to the story. Commenters point out that the original speed comparisons were made against unoptimized C code, and optimized C code with vector intrinsics can close the gap. The patch has not been merged at the time of writing due to a bug being found, and a revised patch offers 55x over generic C. The article concludes with criticism of the author for prematurely reporting the patch without reviewing the full discussion in the FFmpeg development mailing list.\n",

The original poster, cmazakas, is developing an io_uring runtime and faces resistance from developers who believe it's inherently insecure due to past CVEs.\n\nJens Axboe (axboe), the maintainer of liburing, clarifies that the negative perception largely stems from older kernel versions used by Android, which had design flaws in asynchronous offload. These flaws have since been addressed in kernel versions 5.10 and later by changing the thread model. He emphasizes that current io_uring implementations are carefully designed, with extensive testing, and are being used in production at Meta. Axboe points out that security issues are common in the kernel, and io_uring is no less secure than other components.

    "summary": "This article from Brussels Signal reports on concerns within the French government and Senate regarding France's increasing reliance on US tech giants like Microsoft. A French Senate report accuses the government of \"political fault\" for outsourcing essential data infrastructure to these companies, exposing sensitive public data to US extraterritorial laws like FISA and the CLOUD Act. Microsoft France's legal director even admitted they couldn't guarantee French data wouldn't be handed over to foreign authorities.\n\nThe article highlights specific examples like the Ministry of Education signing a deal with a US company and École Polytechnique moving its IT system to Microsoft, despite warnings about sovereignty risks. The National Council for Free Software also criticized these decisions.\n\nFrench MP Philippe Latombe attributes this reliance to \"bureaucratic inertia\" and criticizes the government for discrediting European alternatives as \"too costly\" or \"inefficient.\" He urges consideration of factors beyond price, such as the contribution of French companies to the national social system.\n\nThe article contrasts France's situation with other European nations like Denmark, which are shifting away from Microsoft towards open-source alternatives. An Astéres report reveals that Europe sends a significant amount of money to US companies annually, fueling jobs in the US while leaving Europe digitally exposed.\n\nThe European Commission is viewed as an obstacle to digital sovereignty, prioritizing an open market without preference for national or EU suppliers. The article concludes by highlighting a European Parliament report showing the dominance of US companies in the European cloud infrastructure market, with a significant portion of the West's data stored in the US.\n",

    "summary": "This article outlines an indie maker's realization that launching a high volume of products isn't a sustainable path to success. After launching 37 products in 5 years with limited success (only one going viral), the author questions the \"launch often and hope something sticks\" strategy.\n\nThe author argues that virality is unpredictable and that many \"failed\" launches simply experienced slower growth than anticipated. They cite their current project, Refgrow, as an example, which took six months to acquire its first paying customer but is now experiencing steady growth with minimal marketing.\n\nThe key takeaway is that consistently improving a single project, even with slow growth, appears to yield more reliable results than constantly chasing new ideas. The author emphasizes the value of patience and persistence over the allure of quick wins.\n\nFinally, the author opens a discussion, seeking input from other indie founders. They ask about experiences with focused development versus high-volume launches, the potential for slow growth to pay off, and whether they'd prioritize patience or volume if starting over. The overall tone is reflective and seeks to learn from the experiences of others in the indie making community.\n",

    "summary": "A Delta Connection flight, SkyWest Flight 3788, experienced a near-collision with a US Air Force B-52 bomber while landing in Minot, North Dakota. The incident occurred on Friday evening as the SkyWest plane was cleared for approach when the B-52 became visible.\n\nThe pilot of the regional jet took evasive action, performing what he described as an \"aggressive maneuver\" to avoid the bomber. In audio from the incident, the pilot can be heard apologizing to passengers and explaining that the B-52 was unexpectedly \"coming at us\" and that he hadn't been informed about it. He made a sharp turn based on air traffic control's instructions after initially being directed to turn right.\n\nThe Air Force confirmed that a B-52 from Minot Air Force Base conducted a flyover of the North Dakota State Fair at the same time the SkyWest plane was landing. The flyover was advertised, but apparently not communicated to the SkyWest crew.\n\nBoth SkyWest and the Air Force are investigating the incident. The FAA is also investigating, as the air traffic control tower was operated by a contractor, Midwest ATC. A passenger described the plane jerking \"like we did a U-turn,\" and praised the pilot for his transparency in explaining the situation.\n\nThe pilot's actions and communication were met with applause from passengers. The B-52 is a massive long-range bomber, much larger and faster than the regional jet, capable of carrying heavy ordinance and reaching high altitudes.\n",

Due to the game's unexpected massive success, culminating in Microsoft's $2.5 billion acquisition of Mojang, Rosenfeld's decision to retain ownership of his music rights proved to be a lucrative one. He partnered with Patrick McDermott, a game composer manager, to navigate the business aspects of his Minecraft music.\n\nDespite being offered a buyout by Microsoft, Rosenfeld refused, prioritizing his independence. McDermott helped him build a successful business around the Minecraft soundtrack, resulting in gold certification for \"Minecraft Volume Alpha,\" induction into the Library of Congress, and 2.8 billion streams across digital platforms. They've also built a surprising vinyl business.\n\nWhile Rosenfeld hasn't composed for Minecraft since Microsoft took over, his original score is interpolated in the \"Minecraft Movie,\" giving him some financial benefit. Both Rosenfeld and McDermott highlight the rarity of composers retaining IP ownership in the gaming industry, with most arrangements favoring flat fees. McDermott emphasizes the need for advocates to help composers secure digital and physical royalties. The success of Minecraft's music highlights the growing intersection of music and gaming, with listeners organically streaming the music and purchasing vinyl records, even if they don't own a turntable. They decided not to monetize use of the music on YouTube to promote the game.\n",

    "summary": "This article argues that logical implication (a ⇒ b) can be understood as a comparison operator, specifically a ≤ b, when represented using boolean logic where true is 1 and false is 0. The author observes the similarity in notation between \"⇒\" and \">=\" and uses this as a starting point to explain the connection.\n\nThe core idea is that \"x ⇒ y\" asserts that if x is true (1), then y must also be true (1). The only scenario where the implication fails is when x is true (1) and y is false (0), mirroring the condition where x > y. Therefore, the author proposes that x ≤ y accurately represents the truth value of x ⇒ y.\n\nThe author then demonstrates the usefulness of this interpretation with three examples: transitivity of implication, denying the consequent, and denying the antecedent. By converting these logical statements into inequalities, the proofs become more straightforward and intuitive. For example, transitivity of implication becomes a ≤ b and b ≤ c implying a ≤ c. The article corrects an initial error in the \"Denying the Consequent\" example thanks to feedback. Overall, the article advocates for understanding logical implication as a comparison operator to simplify proofs and gain a deeper understanding of logical relationships.\n",
