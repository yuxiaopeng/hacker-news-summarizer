    "summary": "The article \"I Fixed Windows Native Development\" addresses the common frustrations associated with using the Visual Studio Installer for C++ development. The author argues that \"Installing Visual Studio\" is a poor way to manage dependencies because the IDE is a multi-gigabyte monolith that conflates the editor with the compiler and SDK. This leads to hours-long installations, registry bloat, non-reproducible \"works on my machine\" bugs, and fragile environment configurations using `vcvarsall.bat`.\n\nTo solve this, the author created **msvcup**, an open-source CLI tool that treats the MSVC toolchain as a modern, versioned, and isolated dependency. \n\n**Key Features and Benefits:**\n*   **Targeted Installation:** By parsing Microsoft’s official JSON manifests, `msvcup` downloads only the necessary components (compiler, linker, and SDKs) directly from Microsoft’s CDN.\n*   **Isolation and Portability:** Tools are installed into versioned directories (e.g., `C:\\msvcup\\`), preventing registry pollution and allowing multiple versions to exist side-by-side.\n*   **Declarative Builds:** It supports lock files, ensuring that all contributors and CI systems use identical toolchain versions for reproducible builds.\n*   **Automatic Environments:** The `autoenv` feature creates wrapper executables that automatically set the required environment variables, removing the need for global environment mutations or manual batch script sourcing.\n*   **Speed:** It can set up a full build environment in minutes, with subsequent checks taking only milliseconds.\n\nThe author demonstrates the tool’s efficacy by showing how it can build complex projects like Raylib, LLVM, and WebRTC (at Tuple) via simple scripts. While `msvcup` does not replace the Visual Studio IDE for those who want the graphical editor, it provides a lightweight, scriptable, and reliable alternative for the native Windows build process.",
    "chinese_title": "我修复了 Windows 原生开发",
    "chinese_summary": "《我修复了 Windows 原生开发》一文探讨了使用 Visual Studio Installer 进行 C++ 开发时常见的挫败感。作者指出，“安装 Visual Studio” 并不是管理依赖的好方法，因为该 IDE 是一个数 GB 的庞然大物，将编辑器与编译器、SDK 强行捆绑在一起。这导致了长达数小时的安装过程、注册表膨胀、难以复现的“在我机器上能跑”类 Bug，以及使用 `vcvarsall.bat` 时脆弱的环境配置。\n\n为解决这一问题，作者开发了 **msvcup**。这是一个开源的命令行工具，它将 MSVC 工具链视为现代、版本化且隔离的依赖项。\n\n**核心功能与优势：**\n*   **定向安装：** 通过解析微软官方的 JSON 清单，`msvcup` 直接从微软 CDN 仅下载必要的组件（编译器、链接器和 SDK）。\n*   **隔离与便携性：** 工具安装在版本化的目录中（例如 `C:\\msvcup\\`），避免了注册表污染，并允许不同版本共存。\n*   **声明式构建：** 支持锁定文件，确保所有开发者和 CI 系统使用完全一致的工具链版本，实现可复现的构建。\n*   **自动环境管理：** `autoenv` 功能可创建包装执行文件，自动设置所需的环境变量，无需修改全局环境变量或手动执行批处理脚本。\n*   **高效快捷：** 几分钟内即可完成完整构建环境的搭建，而后续检查仅需几毫秒。\n\n作者通过简单的脚本展示了该工具在构建 Raylib、LLVM 和 WebRTC（在 Tuple 公司）等复杂项目中的效用。虽然 `msvcup` 并非为了取代那些需要图形界面的 Visual Studio IDE 用户，但它为 Windows 原生构建流程提供了一个轻量、可脚本化且可靠的替代方案。"

    "summary": "The European Commission has adopted new measures under the **Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)** to ban the destruction of unsold apparel, clothing accessories, and footwear. This initiative aims to reduce environmental damage and foster a circular economy, addressing the fact that 4–9% of unsold textiles in Europe are currently destroyed before use—a practice generating CO2 emissions equivalent to the total net emissions of Sweden.\n\nKey components of the new regulations include:\n\n*   **A Prohibition on Destruction:** Large companies must stop destroying unsold clothing and footwear by **July 19, 2026**. Medium-sized companies have a transition period until **2030**.\n*   **Mandatory Disclosure:** Businesses must disclose the volume of unsold goods they discard. A standardized format for this reporting will be required starting in **February 2027** for large companies.\n*   **Derogations:** Limited exceptions are permitted for specific circumstances, such as products that are damaged or pose safety risks.\n*   **Circular Alternatives:** The Commission encourages companies to move away from disposal in favor of stock management, resale, remanufacturing, and donations.\n\nBy making products more durable, reusable, and recyclable, the ESPR seeks to eliminate wasteful practices driven by overproduction and online returns. These measures are intended to create a level playing field for sustainable businesses while significantly reducing the textile sector's environmental footprint. Commissioner Jessika Roswall highlighted that these steps will empower the industry to move toward sustainable practices while boosting competitiveness and reducing resource dependencies.",

    "url": "https://lithub.com/how-an-enslaved-gardener-transformed-the-pecan-into-a-cash-crop/",
    "summary": "In this excerpt from *When Trees Testify*, biologist Beronda L. Montgomery highlights the overlooked contributions of Black and Indigenous people to American biology, specifically focusing on an enslaved gardener named Antoine. \n\nWhile Native Americans utilized pecans for centuries—using them for nutrition, medicine, and sacred rituals—the nut remained difficult to commercialize. Early attempts to establish orchards failed because trees grown from seeds were slow to mature and produced inconsistent nut quality. This variability made mass production impossible until Antoine’s breakthrough in the mid-19th century.\n\nAntoine achieved a monumental agricultural feat through \"inosculation,\" or grafting. By successfully joining a scion (shoot) to a rootstock, he developed the \"Centennial\" variety, which produced uniform, high-quality nuts. Montgomery emphasizes the technical difficulty of this process, noting that Antoine succeeded without the sterile environments or advanced tools available to modern scientists. His innovation transformed the pecan into a reproducible cash crop, laying the foundation for an industry that now generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n\nDespite this impact, Antoine’s legacy was nearly erased; his original trees were eventually felled for sugarcane, and his expertise is rarely acknowledged in historical records. Montgomery critiques the broader tendency in scientific literature and history to minimize the agency of enslaved and Indigenous people. She notes that even esteemed figures like Jane Goodall have historically framed enslaved individuals as mere \"laborers\" rather than botanical experts. By centering Antoine’s success and her own family’s traditional plant knowledge, Montgomery seeks to reclaim the history of Black botanical expertise and acknowledge the profound scientific contributions made by those who were denied credit.",

Montgomery）强调了黑人和原住民对美国生物学做出的、长期被忽视的贡献，并重点介绍了一位名叫安托万（Antoine）的被奴役园丁。\n\n尽管美洲原住民利用山核桃已有数百年历史——将其用于营养补给、医药和神圣仪式——但这种坚果长期以来难以实现商业化。早期建立果园的尝试均以失败告终，因为由种子长成的树木成熟缓慢，且产出的坚果质量参差不齐。这种不稳定性使得大规模生产在19世纪中叶安托万取得突破之前一直无法实现。\n\n安托万通过“并接”（即嫁接）实现了一项里程碑式的农业壮举。通过成功地将接穗（嫩枝）与砧木结合，他培育出了“百年”（Centennial）品种，这种品种能产出规格统一且高品质的坚果。蒙哥马利强调了这一过程的技术难度，指出安托万在没有现代科学家所拥有的无菌环境或先进工具的情况下取得了成功。他的创新使山核桃转变为一种可复制的经济作物，为如今每年产值达数亿美元的产业奠定了基础。\n\n尽管影响深远，安托万的遗产却几近湮灭；他最初栽种的树木最终为了改种甘蔗而被砍伐，而他的专业造诣在历史记录中也鲜被承认。蒙哥马利批判了科学文献和历史研究中一种普遍的倾向，即淡化被奴役者和原住民的主观能动性。她指出，即使是像珍·古道尔（Jane Goodall）这样德高望重的人物，在历史上也将被奴役者仅仅视为“劳工”，而非植物学专家。通过聚焦安托万的成就以及她自己家族传承的植物知识，蒙哥马利旨在重申黑人植物学专长的历史，并认可那些被剥夺名誉的人所做出的卓越科学贡献。"
