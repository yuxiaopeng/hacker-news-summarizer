    "summary": "In 1978, ten-year-old Kevin Glikmann was inspired by a trip to Disneyland to design a roller coaster that could go upside down. He envisioned the \"Quadrupuler,\" a ride featuring four loops, and spent five months meticulously constructing a scale model using balsa wood and heat-bent plastic. Guided by the motto \"one piece at a time,\" he eventually sent Polaroids of his masterpiece to Disneyland.\n\nTo his surprise, Glikmann received a personal response from WED Enterprises (Disney’s Imagineering branch), signed by Tom Fitzgerald—who would later become a legendary Imagineer. While the letter explained that Disney was currently focused on building Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, it praised the Quadrupuler as \"quite an adventure.\" \n\nRather than feeling rejected, Glikmann felt deeply validated. This early encouragement gave him a \"bulletproof resilience\" that lasted a lifetime. He continued to invent throughout his youth—including a modified Rubik’s Cube and several patented board games—refusing to be discouraged by subsequent rejections from toy companies. \n\nToday, Glikmann works as an actor, a profession defined by frequent rejection. He credits his persistence in both acting and inventing to that pivotal 1979 letter from Disney. By viewing every challenge through the lens of his childhood motto, he continues to pursue creative discovery, reminding himself that success is built one piece at a time.",

    "chinese_summary": "1978年，十岁的凯文·格利克曼受迪士尼乐园之旅的启发，构思设计一款可以翻转的过山车。他设想了一款名为“Quadrupuler”的设施，其特点是拥有四个环形轨道。他花了五个月时间，利用轻木和热弯塑料精心制作了一个比例模型。在“一次只做一件事”这一座右铭的指引下，他最终将自己杰作的拍立得照片寄给了迪士尼乐园。\n\n令他惊喜的是，格利克曼收到了来自WED企业（迪士尼幻想工程部门）的亲笔回信，签名者是后来成为传奇幻想工程师的汤姆·菲茨杰拉德。虽然信中解释说迪士尼当时正专注于建造“巨雷山惊险之旅”，但仍称赞“Quadrupuler”是“一次相当精彩的冒险”。\n\n格利克曼非但没有感到被拒绝，反而深感获得了认可。这种早期的鼓励赋予了他伴随一生的“坚不可摧的韧性”。他在青少年时期继续进行发明创造——包括一款改良魔方和几款获得专利的棋盘游戏——并拒绝因随后玩具公司的闭门羹而气馁。\n\n如今，格利克曼成为了一名演员，而这正是一个以频繁被拒为常态的职业。他将自己在表演和发明领域的坚持不懈，归功于1979年那封来自迪士尼的关键回信。通过童年座右铭的视角审视每一个挑战，他继续追求着创意发现，并时刻提醒自己：成功是一点一滴铸就的。"

    "url": "https://www.calebleak.com/posts/dog-game/",
    "summary": "After being laid off from Meta, research engineer and author developed a system to let his 9-pound Cavapoo, Momo, \"vibe code\" video games using Claude Code. The project began after Momo accidentally typed on the author's keyboard, sparking the question of whether AI could interpret canine \"nonsense\" as meaningful design.\n\nThe technical pipeline involves Momo typing on a Bluetooth keyboard proxied through a Raspberry Pi to a custom Rust application called \"DogKeyboard.\" This app filters the input and forwards it to Claude Code. To automate the process, a smart pet feeder integrated via Zigbee rewards Momo with treats once she provides sufficient input.\n\nTo bridge the gap between random keystrokes and functional software, the author uses a specific prompt instructing Claude to act as a brilliant developer interpreting \"cryptic\" instructions from an eccentric designer. He selected the Godot engine for development because its text-based scene files are easily manipulated by AI. To ensure playability, the author implemented automated feedback loops, including Python scripts for screenshots and an input-testing tool that allows Claude to act as its own QA tester by playing the games it creates.\n\nThrough two weeks of positive reinforcement training, Momo learned to swipe the keyboard to trigger the AI. The experiment resulted in several functional 3D games—such as *Swamp Snacker* and *Octogroove*—built entirely in C#. The author concludes that while the dog provides the \"vibes,\" the success of the project relies on robust guardrails, specialized linters, and the AI's ability to self-correct through visual and logical feedback.",
    "chinese_title": "我在帮我的狗用 vibe code 写游戏。",
    "chinese_summary": "在被 Meta 裁员后，一位研究工程师兼作家开发了一套系统，让他 9 磅重的卡瓦普犬 Momo 利用 Claude Code 进行“氛围感编程”（vibe code）来制作视频游戏。该项目起源于 Momo 意外踩踏了作者的键盘，从而引发了一个思考：AI 是否能将犬类的“胡言乱语”解读为有意义的设计。\n\n技术流程包括 Momo 在蓝牙键盘上敲击，信号通过树莓派代理发送至名为“DogKeyboard”的自定义 Rust 应用程序。该程序负责过滤输入并将其转发给 Claude Code。为了实现自动化，系统还通过 Zigbee 集成了一台智能宠物喂食器，一旦 Momo 提供了足够的输入，便会获得零食奖励。\n\n为了弥合随机按键与功能性软件之间的差距，作者使用了一个特定的提示词，指示 Claude 扮演一名才华横溢的开发人员，负责解读来自一位“古怪设计师”的“神秘指令”。他选择了 Godot 引擎进行开发，因为该引擎基于文本的场景文件易于被 AI 操作。为确保游戏的可玩性，作者实现了自动化反馈循环，包括用于抓取屏幕截图的 Python 脚本，以及一个输入测试工具，让 Claude 能够通过运行自己创建的游戏来充当自身的 QA 测试员。\n\n经过两周的正向激励训练，Momo 学会了通过刷键盘来触发 AI。实验最终产出了几款功能完备的 3D 游戏——例如《沼泽点心》（Swamp Snacker）和《八角律动》（Octogroove）——且完全由 C# 编写。作者总结道，虽然狗狗提供了“氛围感”（vibes），但项目的成功仍依赖于强大的约束机制、专门的代码检查器以及 AI 通过视觉和逻辑反馈进行自我纠错的能力。"

    "summary": "In 2017, Samsung announced a revolutionary \"Galaxy Upcycling\" initiative, promising to help users repurpose old smartphones by unlocking bootloaders and providing an open-source marketplace for custom applications. Partnering with iFixit, the vision included turning old hardware into everything from Bitcoin miners to smart home hubs.\n\nHowever, the program faced years of silence and internal resistance. Critics argue that the project lacked a revenue model and directly conflicted with Samsung’s core business of selling new hardware. When \"Galaxy Upcycling at Home\" finally launched in 2021, it was a shadow of the original promise. Instead of an open-source ecosystem, it offered only two basic functions—sound and light sensing—limited to relatively modern devices that still held significant resale value.\n\nDespite this \"stripped-down\" implementation, Samsung won a Reuters \"Circular Transition Award\" for the program. The author highlights the irony of this recognition, noting that Samsung’s actual e-waste recovery rate remains abysmal (0.0019%). Furthermore, iFixit officially ended its partnership with Samsung in 2024, citing high part prices, restrictive repair policies, and designs that prioritized glue over accessibility.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes that while users can still DIY their own upcycling projects using third-party apps or custom ROMs (like LineageOS), Samsung’s official vision of a manufacturer-backed, open-source ecosystem is effectively dead. The company chose to prioritize its hardware sales and software control over genuine sustainability, leaving the original \"Upcycle\" promise as little more than a successful PR exercise.",
    "chinese_title": "三星升级再造承诺",
    "chinese_summary": "2017年，三星宣布了一项具有革命意义的“Galaxy Upcycling”（Galaxy 升级再造）计划，承诺通过解锁引导加载程序（bootloader）并为自定义应用提供开源市场，帮助用户重新利用旧智能手机。通过与 iFixit 合作，该愿景旨在将旧硬件转化为从比特币矿机到智能家居控制枢纽的各种设备。\n\n然而，该计划随后陷入了多年的沉寂并面临内部阻力。批评者认为，该项目缺乏盈利模式，且与三星销售新硬件的核心业务直接冲突。当“Galaxy Upcycling at Home”最终于 2021 年推出时，它已远非最初承诺的模样。它并未提供开源生态系统，而仅提供了两项基本功能——声音和光线感应，且仅限于仍具有较高转售价值的较新型号设备。\n\n尽管这种实施方案大打折扣，三星仍凭借该项目获得了路透社颁发的“循环转型奖”。作者强调了这一奖项的讽刺性，指出三星实际的电子垃圾回收率依然微乎其微（0.0019%）。此外，iFixit 于 2024 年正式结束了与三星的合作，理由是零部件价格高昂、维修政策苛刻，以及产品设计优先考虑大量使用胶水而非易维修性。\n\n文章最后总结道，虽然用户仍可以使用第三方应用或自定义 ROM（如 LineageOS）自行开展升级再造项目，但三星官方提出的由厂商支持的开源生态系统愿景实际上已经破灭。该公司选择优先考虑硬件销售和软件控制，而非真正的可持续发展，这使得最初的“升级再造”承诺最终沦为一场成功的公关秀。"

    "summary": "Kansai International Airport in Osaka has maintained a remarkable record of never losing a single piece of luggage since it opened in 1994. This 30-year streak of perfect baggage handling recently earned the facility the title of “World’s Best Airport for Baggage Delivery” at the World Airport Awards 2024—the eighth time it has received this honor.\n\nThe airport’s success is attributed to a combination of advanced technology and meticulous manual oversight. During peak periods, the facility handles up to 30,000 pieces of checked luggage daily. To prevent loss, the airport utilizes sensors along conveyor belts supplemented by staff members who patrol the cargo areas to check for dropped items. \n\nKansai is also recognized for its exceptional customer service. Ground support personnel manually align the handles of suitcases on arrival carousels so they face outward, allowing passengers to retrieve their bags more easily.\n\nLooking ahead, the airport faces the dual challenge of staffing shortages and an expected surge in passengers for the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo. To preserve its perfect record and maintain high standards of service, airport officials plan to invest in system upgrades and technological improvements to enhance operational efficiency.",

    "summary": "A coalition of 37 civil society organizations and technology companies—including the EFF, F-Droid, and Proton—has issued an open letter to Google’s leadership opposing a new policy requiring mandatory developer registration for all Android app distribution. Set to take effect in early 2026, the policy mandates that even developers distributing apps through third-party stores or direct downloads must register with Google, provide government ID, and pay a fee.\n\nThe signatories argue that this move fundamentally undermines Android's historic openness by positioning Google as a universal gatekeeper. Key concerns outlined in the letter include:\n\n*   **Barriers to Entry:** The policy creates bureaucratic and financial hurdles that disproportionately affect open-source projects, small developers, and humanitarian organizations.\n*   **Privacy and Surveillance:** It establishes a centralized database of all developers worldwide, posing risks for those working on politically sensitive or privacy-preserving tools.\n*   **Anti-competitive Advantage:** The mandate allows Google to monitor all development activity outside its marketplace, providing an unfair intelligence advantage and raising antitrust concerns.\n*   **Arbitrary Control:** Centralizing registration gives Google the power to unilaterally disable applications across the entire ecosystem, regardless of the distribution channel.\n\nThe letter asserts that Android’s existing security features—such as sandboxing and user warnings—are already sufficient to protect users. The coalition calls on Google to immediately rescind the policy and commit to platform neutrality. They conclude that centralizing the power to approve all software is a threat to digital sovereignty, competition, and the principles of free speech upon which the Android ecosystem was built.",
