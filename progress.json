    "summary": "Cloudflare has acquired The Astro Technology Company, the team behind the popular Astro web framework. This move is designed to provide the Astro team with the stability and resources to focus entirely on framework development, following their previous struggles to build a sustainable business model around hosted primitives like Astro DB.\n\nDespite the acquisition, several key aspects of Astro will remain unchanged:\n*   **Open Source:** Astro stays open-source under the MIT license.\n*   **Governance:** The existing open governance model and community roadmap will remain in place.\n*   **Platform Agnostic:** Astro will continue to support all deployment targets and hosting providers, not just Cloudflare.\n*   **Dedicated Team:** All full-time Astro employees are joining Cloudflare to continue working on the framework full-time.\n\nAstro was founded in 2021 to prioritize \"content-driven\" websites over complex, state-heavy applications. It has since seen massive growth, reaching nearly one million weekly downloads and adoption by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Webflow. \n\nBy joining Cloudflare—a long-time sponsor and advocate for the framework—the Astro team aims to eliminate the \"distraction\" of monetization. This allows them to focus 100% on their mission to build a faster, more performant web. Moving forward, the team is prioritizing the release of Astro 6 (currently in beta) and executing their long-term roadmap through 2026.",
    "chinese_title": "Cloudflare 收购 Astro",
    "chinese_summary": "Cloudflare 已收购热门 Web 框架 Astro 的开发团队 The Astro Technology Company。此举旨在为 Astro 团队提供所需的稳定性与资源，使其能够全身心地投入到框架开发中；此前，该团队在围绕 Astro DB 等托管原语建立可持续商业模式方面曾面临挑战。\n\n尽管发生了收购，但 Astro 的几个关键方面将保持不变：\n*   **开源：** Astro 将继续在 MIT 协议下保持开源。\n*   **治理：** 现有的开放治理模式和社区路线图将维持不变。\n*   **平台无关性：** Astro 将继续支持所有部署目标和托管服务商，而不仅仅是 Cloudflare。\n*   **专属团队：** 所有 Astro 全职员工都将加入 Cloudflare，继续全职从事该框架的开发工作。\n\nAstro 成立于 2021 年，旨在优先发展“内容驱动型”网站，而非复杂的重状态应用。自此以后，它经历了飞速增长，每周下载量已接近 100 万次，并被谷歌、微软和 Webflow 等知名公司采用。\n\n通过加入 Cloudflare——该框架的长期赞助者和倡导者——Astro 团队旨在消除商业变现带来的“干扰”。这使他们能够 100% 地专注于构建更快速、性能更卓越的 Web 这一使命。展望未来，团队正优先发布 Astro 6（目前处于 Beta 阶段），并执行其直至 2026 年的长期路线图。"

    "url": "https://letsencrypt.org/2026/01/15/6day-and-ip-general-availability",
    "summary": "Let’s Encrypt has announced the general availability of **short-lived certificates** and **IP address certificates**. \n\n**Short-Lived Certificates**\nThese certificates are valid for 160 hours (approximately six days) and are available as an opt-in feature via the \"shortlived\" profile in ACME clients. The primary goal is to enhance security; by significantly shortening the expiration window, Let's Encrypt reduces the risk associated with compromised private keys and bypasses the limitations of traditional, often unreliable, revocation mechanisms. While these are currently optional, Let's Encrypt intends to reduce its standard 90-day certificate lifetime to 45 days over the coming years.\n\n**IP Address Certificates**\nThe service now supports certificates for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, allowing operators to authenticate TLS connections directly to an IP rather than a domain name. Because IP addresses are more transient than domains, Let’s Encrypt requires all IP certificates to use the short-lived (6-day) format to ensure frequent re-validation.\n\n**Implementation and Support**\nThese features are aimed at users who have fully automated their renewal processes. The development of these tools was supported by the Open Technology Fund, the Sovereign Tech Agency, and various corporate sponsors and donors. The transition reflects a broader effort to move the industry toward automated, high-frequency validation to improve the overall security of the web.",
    "chinese_title": "6天期及IP地址证书现已正式发布",
    "chinese_summary": "Let’s Encrypt 宣布正式推出**短期证书**和 **IP 地址证书**。\n\n**短期证书**\n这些证书的有效期为 160 小时（约 6 天），用户可以通过 ACME 客户端中的“shortlived”配置文件选择使用。其主要目标是增强安全性；通过大幅缩短有效期，Let's Encrypt 降低了私钥泄露相关的风险，并绕过了传统且通常不可靠的撤销机制的局限性。虽然这些证书目前是可选的，但 Let's Encrypt 计划在未来几年内将其标准的 90 天证书有效期缩短至 45 天。\n\n**IP 地址证书**\n该服务现在支持 IPv4 和 IPv6 地址证书，允许运营商直接针对 IP 地址而非域名进行 TLS 连接验证。由于 IP 地址比域名更具临时性，Let’s Encrypt 要求所有 IP 证书必须采用短期（6 天）格式，以确保频繁的重新验证。\n\n**实施与支持**\n这些功能旨在面向已实现完全自动化续期流程的用户。这些工具的开发得到了开放技术基金会（Open Technology Fund）、Sovereign Tech Agency 以及各企业赞助商和捐助者的支持。这一转变反映了行业正努力推动自动化、高频率验证，以提升互联网的整体安全性。"

    "url": "https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/discover-michelangelos-first-painting.html",
    "summary": "This article explores the history and authentication of **“The Torment of Saint Anthony,”** the first known painting by Michelangelo, created when he was just 12 or 13 years old. \n\nThough based on a well-known engraving, the work was not attributed to the Renaissance master for nearly 500 years. Its true origin began to surface after it was sold at Sotheby’s in 2008 and sent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for restoration. Cleaning revealed a color palette and anatomical style remarkably similar to Michelangelo’s later work on the Sistine Chapel. Furthermore, infrared reflectography identified *pentimenti* (original correction marks), proving the piece was an original composition rather than a mere copy.\n\nThe painting was eventually purchased by the **Kimbell Art Museum** in Fort Worth, Texas. It holds the distinction of being the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas and one of only four easel paintings attributed to him in existence. While some skeptics remain, the attribution was definitively supported by prominent art historian Giorgio Bonsanti following extensive analysis. The work serves as a testament to Michelangelo's precocious talent, showcasing advanced technique and creativity well before he achieved international fame.",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了**《圣安东尼的诱惑》**（*The Torment of Saint Anthony*）的历史与鉴定过程。这是米开朗基罗已知的第一幅画作，创作于他仅12或13岁时。\n\n尽管该作品基于一幅著名的版画，但在近500年的时间里，它一直未被归为这位文艺复兴大师之手。直到2008年，该画作在苏富比拍卖行售出并被送往大都会艺术博物馆进行修复，其真实身世才开始浮出水面。修复清洗揭示了其色调和解剖学风格，与米开朗基罗后来在西斯廷礼拜堂的作品惊人地相似。此外，红外反射成像技术发现了“修改痕迹”（*pentimenti*），证明这件作品是原创构思，而非单纯的临摹。\n\n这幅画最终由德克萨斯州沃斯堡的**坎贝尔艺术博物馆**（Kimbell Art Museum）购得。它是美洲境内唯一的米开朗基罗画作，也是现存仅有的四幅被归于其名下的架上画之一。尽管仍有部分人持怀疑态度，但在经过深入分析后，著名艺术史学家乔治·邦桑蒂（Giorgio Bonsanti）明确支持这一鉴定结论。这件作品见证了米开朗基罗早慧的天赋，展现了他在享誉国际之前便已具备的高超技艺与创造力。"

    "summary": "**Just the Browser** is an open-source project designed to strip mainstream web browsers—specifically Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox—of modern \"bloatware.\" Its primary goal is to provide a clean, distraction-free browsing experience by disabling AI features (like Copilot), telemetry data collection, sponsored content, shopping integrations, and intrusive \"default browser\" prompts.\n\n**How it Works**\nThe project does not modify the browser’s executable code. Instead, it utilizes official \"group policy\" settings—hidden configurations typically reserved for IT departments and large organizations. Because it uses these native enterprise tools, the changes are stable and fully supported by the browsers, though users will see a \"Managed by your organization\" notification in their settings.\n\n**Key Features Removed:**\n*   **AI & Suggestions:** Generative AI tools and automated tab group suggestions.\n*   **Commercial Bloat:** Shopping tools, price trackers, and coupon finders.\n*   **Data Reporting:** Most telemetry and background data collection.\n*   **Annoyances:** Welcome screens, startup boost features, and persistent data-import prompts.\n\n**Installation and Support**\nThe project offers automated installation scripts via PowerShell for Windows and Terminal for macOS/Linux. Manual configuration guides are also available for users who wish to customize which settings are applied. While it currently supports major desktop platforms, mobile versions for Android and iOS are not yet available.\n\n**Philosophy**\nThe creator argues that \"Just the Browser\" is a safer alternative to switching to niche browsers, which may lag behind on critical security updates. By using these configuration files, users can maintain the performance and security of mainstream browser engines while removing the corporate features that clutter the user interface. It does not include an ad blocker, recommending third-party extensions like uBlock Origin for that purpose.",
