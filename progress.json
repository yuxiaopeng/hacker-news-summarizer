    "title": "The Age Verification Trap: Verifying age undermines everyone's data protection",
    "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/age-verification",
    "summary": "In \"The Age Verification Trap,\" Waydell D. Carvalho argues that government-mandated age verification (AV) systems, while intended to protect minors from harmful content, create significant privacy and security risks for all internet users. Carvalho posits that these mandates shift the digital landscape from one of pseudonymity to one of persistent surveillance.\n\nThe summary of the author’s key points includes:\n\n*   **The Erosion of Privacy:** AV typically requires users to provide sensitive information, such as government-issued IDs or biometric data (facial scans). This forces individuals to trade their anonymity for access to digital services, creating a \"honeypot\" of sensitive data that is highly attractive to hackers and identity thieves.\n*   **The End of Pseudonymity:** By linking a person’s legal identity to their online behavior, AV allows platforms and third-party verifiers to track private browsing habits, interests, and affiliations. This data can be exploited for profiling or state surveillance.\n*   **Ineffectiveness and Circumvention:** Carvalho notes that AV is often easily bypassed by tech-savvy minors using VPNs or \"gray market\" accounts. Consequently, the systems fail to protect the very demographic they target while successfully stripping privacy rights from law-abiding adults.\n*   **Centralization Risks:** Many AV solutions rely on third-party providers, creating a centralized point of failure. If a major verification hub is breached, the personal identities of millions of users are compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nInstead of centralized identity checks, Carvalho advocates for \"safety by design\" and decentralized, device-level controls. He suggests that the focus should remain on empowering parents and utilizing technical signals at the browser or OS level, rather than building a permanent surveillance infrastructure that undermines the fundamental right to data protection.",
    "chinese_title": "年龄验证陷阱：年龄验证削弱了每个人的数据保护。",
    "chinese_summary": "在《年龄验证陷阱》一文中，韦戴尔·D·卡瓦略（Waydell D. Carvalho）指出，政府强制执行的年龄验证（AV）系统虽然旨在保护未成年人免受有害内容侵害，但却给所有互联网用户带来了显著的隐私和安全风险。卡瓦略认为，这些强制令将数字环境从伪匿名状态转变为持续监控状态。\n\n作者的核心观点总结如下：\n\n*   **隐私侵蚀：** 年龄验证通常要求用户提供敏感信息，如政府颁发的身份证件或生物识别数据（面部扫描）。这迫使个人为了获得数字服务而放弃匿名性，从而形成了一个对黑客和身份窃贼极具吸引力的敏感数据“蜜罐”。\n*   **伪匿名的终结：** 通过将个人的法律身份与其在线行为挂钩，年龄验证允许平台和第三方验证者追踪私人浏览习惯、兴趣和归属关系。这些数据可能被用于用户画像或政府监控。\n*   **无效性与规避：** 卡瓦略指出，精通技术的未成年人经常利用 VPN 或“灰色市场”账户轻松绕过年龄验证。因此，这些系统未能保护其目标群体，却剥夺了守法成年人的隐私权。\n*   **中心化风险：** 许多年龄验证解决方案依赖第三方供应商，导致了中心化的单点故障。如果主要的验证枢纽遭到入侵，数百万用户的个人身份信息都将面临泄露风险。\n\n**结论：**\n卡瓦略主张采用“安全源于设计”和去中心化的设备端控制，而非中心化的身份检查。他建议，重点应放在赋予家长权利以及利用浏览器或操作系统层面的技术信号上，而不是建立一套破坏数据保护基本权利的永久性监控基础设施。"

    "title": "Ladybird Browser adopts Rust",
    "url": "https://ladybird.org/posts/adopting-rust/",
    "summary": "Andreas Kling, founder of the Ladybird Browser, has announced that the project is officially adopting Rust to replace C++ for improved memory safety. While the team previously explored Swift and had reservations about Rust’s compatibility with legacy web object models, they ultimately chose Rust due to its mature systems programming ecosystem and strong contributor support.\n\nThe transition began with **LibJS**, Ladybird’s JavaScript engine. Using AI tools like Claude Code and Codex for human-directed translation, Kling ported approximately 25,000 lines of code—covering the lexer, parser, and bytecode generator—in just two weeks. This process, which would have otherwise taken months, focused on achieving byte-for-byte identical output to the original C++ pipeline.\n\n**Key results include:**\n*   **Zero Regressions:** The Rust implementation passed all 52,898 test262 tests and 12,461 internal regression tests.\n*   **Performance Parity:** No performance loss was recorded on JS benchmarks.\n*   **Compatibility:** The current Rust code intentionally mimics C++ patterns to ensure identical bytecode generation, though it will be refined into more idiomatic Rust over time.\n\nMoving forward, Ladybird will not abandon C++ immediately. Instead, the two languages will coexist through well-defined interop boundaries. The core team will manage the porting of subsystems incrementally to ensure stability, requiring contributors to coordinate closely on any new Rust-related work. Kling views this shift as a pragmatic and essential step for the browser’s long-term security and viability.",
    "chinese_title": "Ladybird 浏览器采用 Rust",
    "chinese_summary": "Ladybird浏览器创始人Andreas Kling宣布，该项目正式采用Rust语言替换C++，以提升内存安全性。尽管团队此前曾调研过Swift，并对Rust与旧有Web对象模型的兼容性持保留意见，但最终因其成熟的系统编程生态和强大的贡献者支持而选择了Rust。\n\n转型从Ladybird的JavaScript引擎**LibJS**开始。Kling利用Claude Code和Codex等AI工具在人工引导下进行转换，仅用两周时间就移植了约2.5万行代码，涵盖了词法分析器、解析器和字节码生成器。这一过程原本可能需要数月时间，其核心目标是确保输出与原有的C++管线保持字节级的一致。\n\n**关键结果包括：**\n*   **零回归：** Rust实现通过了全部52,898项test262测试和12,461项内部回归测试。\n*   **性能持平：** 在JS基准测试中未记录到性能损失。\n*   **兼容性：** 目前的Rust代码有意模仿C++模式，以确保生成相同的字节码，未来将逐步重构为更符合Rust规范的代码。\n\n展望未来，Ladybird不会立即放弃C++，而是让两种语言通过明确的互操作边界共存。核心团队将分阶段管理子系统的移植以确保稳定性，并要求贡献者在任何涉及Rust的新工作中进行密切协作。Kling认为，这一转变是保障浏览器长期安全性和生命力的务实且必要的一步。"

    "url": "https://rsdoiel.github.io/blog/2026/02/21/a_simple_web_we_own.html",
    "summary": "In \"A simple web we own,\" R. S. Doiel argues that the modern internet has devolved into a \"surveillance economy\" controlled by large corporations and governments, reducing users to mere \"tenants and products.\" To counter this \"enshittification,\" Doiel proposes a shift toward individual and cooperative ownership of both hardware and software, suggesting that widespread personal ownership could influence the digital landscape much like labor unions influenced the industrial political economy.\n\nThe article identifies a significant barrier to this shift: the perceived complexity of web publishing. While \"Big Tech\" maintains the myth that only large platforms can provide ease of use, Doiel highlights that modern tools have simplified the process. Specifically, the author advocates for using **Markdown**—a simple way to write hypertext—combined with software that automatically generates HTML, RSS feeds, and sitemaps. This \"single-speed bicycle\" approach replaces complex, resource-heavy systems like WordPress with lightweight, static alternatives that writers can manage without developer-level skills.\n\nThe author emphasizes that the technical and financial barriers to entry have vanished. Affordable hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi, allows individuals to own their computing power for a fraction of the cost of a smartphone. By treating the \"internet\" and \"web\" as common nouns—decentralized networks of networks rather than monolithic corporate platforms—users can leverage existing protocols (IPv4/IPv6) to host their own content on private or public networks. \n\nUltimately, Doiel concludes that a \"simple web\" is achievable through three core components:\n1. Individually owned and controlled computing devices.\n2. Individually controlled networks.\n3. Simple software that empowers users to read and write hypertext without relying on centralized intermediaries.",
    "chinese_title": "我们拥有的简单网络",
    "chinese_summary": "在《我们拥有的简单网络》一文中，R. S. Doiel 指出，现代互联网已退化为由大公司和政府控制的“监控经济”，将用户降格为单纯的“租户和产品”。为了对抗这种“平台颓败”（enshittification），Doiel 提议向硬件和软件的个人及协作所有权转变，并认为广泛的个人所有权可以像工会影响工业政治经济那样重塑数字格局。\n\n文章指出，实现这一转变的一个重大障碍是人们感知的网页发布复杂性。尽管“大科技公司”维持着只有大型平台才能提供易用性的神话，但 Doiel 强调，现代工具已经简化了这一过程。具体而言，作者提倡使用 Markdown（一种简单的超文本编写方式），并结合能自动生成 HTML、RSS 提要和站点地图的软件。这种“单速自行车”方案用轻量级的静态替代方案取代了 WordPress 等复杂且耗资源的系统，使作者无需开发者级别的技能即可进行管理。\n\n作者强调，技术和资金准入门槛已经消失。像树莓派（Raspberry Pi）这样经济实惠的硬件，让个人只需花费智能手机一小部分的成本，就能拥有自己的计算能力。通过将“互联网”（internet）和“万维网”（web）视为普通名词——即去中心化的网络之网，而非单一的公司平台——用户可以利用现有协议（IPv4/IPv6）在私有或公共网络上托管自己的内容。\n\n最终，Doiel 总结道，通过三个核心要素即可实现“简单的网络”：\n1. 个人拥有并控制的计算设备。\n2. 个人控制的网络。\n3. 能够赋能用户读写超文本，且无需依赖中心化中间商的简单软件。"

    "title": "Half million 'Words with Spaces' missing from dictionaries",
    "url": "https://www.linguabase.org/words-with-spaces.html",
    "summary": "In the article \"Half million 'Words with Spaces' missing from dictionaries,\" the author explores why traditional lexicography ignores hundreds of thousands of \"multi-word expressions\" (MWEs) that function as single semantic units. Phrases like \"boiling water,\" \"Saturday night,\" and \"paper towel\" are often excluded from major dictionaries because they contain spaces and their meanings are considered \"transparent\" or self-evident.\n\nThe author, a word game designer, used Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify approximately 774,000 MWEs that carry specific \"conceptual weight.\" The study reveals a massive coverage gap: traditional dictionaries like Merriam-Webster and Oxford cover only about 2% of these terms, while the crowdsourced Wiktionary covers roughly 30%. \n\nThe article categorizes these missing \"words with spaces\" into several types:\n*   **Transparent/Semi-opaque:** Phrases that name specific concepts (e.g., \"high school,\" \"front door\").\n*   **Technical:** Jargon and scientific terms (e.g., \"machine learning\").\n*   **Opaque:** Idioms where the meaning isn't literal (e.g., \"hot dog,\" \"red tape\").\n*   **Other:** Phrasal verbs, binomials (e.g., \"black and white\"), and institutional phrases.\n\nThe author argues that the historical preference for single \"building block\" words is a legacy of print-era space constraints. In reality, the \"naming function\"—the ability of a phrase to invoke a specific concept or state of matter—is what truly defines a word. By excluding MWEs, dictionaries narrow our sense of vocabulary. For word games and linguistics alike, these phrases represent a \"deep reservoir\" of valid language that functions identically to single words, suggesting that the presence of a space should not disqualify a term from being recognized as a legitimate lexical unit.",
    "chinese_title": "五十万个“带空格的词”未被词典收录。",
    "chinese_summary": "在《五十万个“带空格的词”未被词典收录》一文中，作者探讨了传统词典编纂学为何忽略了数十万个作为独立语义单位运作的“多词表达”（MWEs）。像“boiling water”（开水）、“Saturday night”（周六晚上）和“paper towel”（纸巾）这类短语常因含有空格且含义被视为“透明”或显而易见，而被主流词典拒之门外。\n\n作者是一位词汇游戏设计师，他利用大语言模型（LLMs）识别出约 77.4 万个具有特定“概念权重”的多词表达。研究揭示了一个巨大的收录缺口：诸如《韦氏词典》和《牛津词典》等传统词典仅涵盖其中约 2% 的术语，而众包的维基词典（Wiktionary）则涵盖了约 30%。\n\n文章将这些缺失的“带空格的词”分为以下几类：\n*   **透明/半透明型：** 命名特定概念的短语（如“high school/高中”、“front door/前门”）。\n*   **技术型：** 行话和科学术语（如“machine learning/机器学习”）。\n*   **不透明型：** 含义并非字面意思的习语（如“hot dog/热狗”、“red tape/官僚作风”）。\n*   **其他：** 短语动词、成对词（如“black and white/黑白”）以及机构化短语。\n\n作者认为，历史上对单一“构词块”单词的偏爱是印刷时代空间限制的遗留产物。实际上，“命名功能”——即一个短语唤起特定概念或事物状态的能力——才是定义单词的真正核心。通过排除多词表达，词典收窄了我们的词汇感知。对于词汇游戏和语言学而言，这些短语构成了一个有效语言的“深层蓄水池”，其功能与单一单词完全一致。这表明，空格的存在不应成为一个术语被认定为合法词汇单元的障碍。"

    "url": "https://github.com/pgdogdev/pgdog",
    "summary": "PgDog is a high-performance PostgreSQL proxy written in Rust, designed to scale databases without requiring application-level changes. It provides three primary functions: connection pooling, load balancing, and sharding.\n\nAs a connection pooler, PgDog supports both session and transaction pooling. Unlike PgBouncer, it parses `SET` statements and startup options to maintain session state correctly when sharing connections. For load balancing, it operates at the application layer (Level 7), using a native PostgreSQL parser to automatically route writes to the primary and reads to replicas. It includes real-time health checks and supports failover orchestration by monitoring replication states.\n\nThe tool’s most significant feature is its horizontal sharding capability. It supports both partition-based (Hash, List, Range) and schema-based sharding. PgDog handles complex cross-shard queries by assembling and transforming results in memory, presenting a unified view to the client. Advanced sharding features include:\n\n*   **Two-phase commits (2PC):** Ensures atomic writes across multiple shards.\n*   **Online re-sharding:** Uses logical replication to migrate or split data without downtime.\n*   **Query Rewriting:** Automatically handles shard key updates and splits multi-tuple inserts across different shards.\n*   **Unique ID Generation:** Provides a timestamp-based algorithm for creating unique BIGINT identifiers without cross-shard sequences.\n\nPgDog is production-ready and can be deployed via Kubernetes (Helm), AWS (ECS/EKS), or Docker. It is compatible with standard PostgreSQL clients and offers monitoring through an OpenMetrics endpoint and a PgBouncer-style admin interface. Its ability to parse SQL allows it to handle complex routing logic—such as identifying read-only transactions—while maintaining high throughput on commodity hardware.",
