    "title": "Bus stop balancing is fast, cheap, and effective",
    "url": "https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-united-states-needs-fewer-bus-stops/",
    "summary": "**Summary: Bus Stop Balancing**\n\nBus stop balancing—the strategic removal of redundant stops to increase spacing—offers a fast, low-cost, and highly effective way to improve urban transit. While major rail projects receive the most attention, buses carry more passengers and have recovered faster post-pandemic. However, in many U.S. and U.K. cities, buses are hindered by stops placed as close as 700 feet apart, resulting in \"crawling\" speeds that make transit uncompetitive with driving.\n\nBy adopting the European model of wider spacing (approximately 1,300 feet), transit agencies can realize several critical benefits:\n\n*   **Increased Speed and Efficiency:** Removing stops reduces both \"dwell time\" (passengers boarding) and \"non-dwell time\" (braking, accelerating, and navigating traffic). Implementation in cities like San Francisco and Vancouver has resulted in speed increases of up to 14% and significant time savings for riders.\n*   **Cost Savings:** Labor is a transit agency's largest expense. Faster buses complete routes more quickly, requiring fewer vehicles and drivers to maintain the same frequency. These savings can be reinvested to increase service elsewhere.\n*   **Improved Reliability:** Fewer stops mean fewer opportunities for schedule delays and variability, addressing one of the primary frustrations for commuters.\n*   **Enhanced Amenities:** By maintaining fewer locations, agencies can afford to upgrade remaining stops with better shelters, seating, lighting, and real-time information—transforming \"a pole with a sign\" into a high-quality transit hub.\n\nWhile critics argue that consolidation reduces coverage, studies show that because of overlapping \"walksheds,\" the actual impact on accessibility is minimal. Ultimately, stop balancing shifts the focus from mere coverage to meaningful access, allowing riders to reach more destinations in less time. It remains a rare example of a transit reform that requires no new infrastructure yet delivers immediate, measurable results.",
    "chinese_title": "公交站点优化快速、廉价且有效。",
    "chinese_summary": "**摘要：公交站点优化**\n\n公交站点优化（Bus stop balancing）——即通过战略性地移除冗余站点来增加站间距——是改善城市交通的一种快速、低成本且高效的方式。虽然大型轨道交通项目往往备受关注，但公交车承载了更多的乘客，且在疫情后恢复得更快。然而，在美英两国的许多城市，公交站点间距仅为700英尺左右，导致车辆行驶缓慢，使其在与私家车的竞争中缺乏优势。\n\n通过采用欧洲间距更宽（约1,300英尺）的模式，交通管理部门可以获得以下关键收益：\n\n*   **提高速度与效率：** 减少站点既缩短了“停站时间”（乘客上下车），也减少了“非停站时间”（减速、加速及应对交通流量）。在旧金山和温哥华等城市的实施结果显示，车速提升了高达14%，为乘客节省了大量时间。\n*   **节省成本：** 人工成本是交通部门最大的开支。更快的公交车能更迅速地完成运行路线，从而只需更少的车辆和司机即可维持相同的发车频率。节省下的资金可重新投入到其他线路的服务中。\n*   **提高可靠性：** 站点减少意味着行程延误和变数的机会减少，解决了通勤者最主要的困扰之一。\n*   **改善配套设施：** 通过维护更少的站点，管理部门有能力对剩余站点进行升级，配备更好的候车亭、座椅、照明和实时信息系统，将“孤零零的站牌”转化为高质量的交通枢纽。\n\n尽管批评者认为站点整合会降低覆盖范围，但研究表明，由于“步行覆盖区”存在重叠，对实际可达性的影响微乎其微。最终，站点优化将重点从单纯的地理覆盖转向了实质性的便捷通达，让乘客能在更短时间内到达更多目的地。它是交通改革中一个罕见的范例：无需新建基础设施，却能产生立竿见影且可衡量的效果。"

    "summary": "The author, a long-time \".com purist,\" shares a cautionary tale about purchasing a **.online** domain through a Namecheap promotion. Shortly after launching a simple landing page for a browser app, the site was flagged as \"unsafe\" by Google and placed on **serverHold** status by the registry, Radix.\n\nThis triggered a technical \"Catch-22\":\n1.  **The Registry (Radix)** refused to lift the serverHold until Google removed the site from its blacklist.\n2.  **Google** required the author to verify ownership via DNS records in Search Console to request a review.\n3.  **The Conflict:** Because the domain was on serverHold, it would not resolve, making DNS verification impossible.\n\nWith no notifications from the registrar or registry and no clear path to resolution through automated channels, the author’s site remained offline and inaccessible. The situation was only resolved after the story gained traction on Hacker News, leading an anonymous Google employee to manually remove the blacklist flag, which finally allowed Radix to release the domain.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n*   **Stick to .com:** Standard TLDs are less likely to face aggressive, automated registry-level bans.\n*   **Immediate Verification:** Always add new domains to Google Search Console immediately so ownership is established before a potential ban occurs.\n*   **Observability:** Even for small projects, use uptime monitoring to catch silent DNS failures.\n*   **The Risk of \"Weird\" TLDs:** Niche registries may have hair-trigger abuse policies and poor communication, leaving owners with little recourse if flagged.",

    "summary": "The article \"Large-Scale Online Deanonymization with LLMs\" highlights groundbreaking research from ETH Zurich regarding the erosion of digital privacy. The study demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, can accurately infer highly sensitive personal information from seemingly anonymous social media comments.\n\nBy analyzing a dataset of over 500 Reddit profiles, researchers found that LLMs can predict attributes—including location, age, gender, occupation, and even income—with alarming precision. In the study, GPT-4 achieved up to 85% accuracy for top-1 predictions and 95.8% for top-3. The models succeed by \"connecting the dots\" between subtle clues scattered across multiple posts, such as mentions of local landmarks, specific commutes, or life milestones.\n\nThe key findings and implications include:\n\n*   **Mass-Scale Profiling:** Unlike human experts, who can perform similar profiling but at a high cost of time and labor, LLMs allow for automated, low-cost deanonymization at a massive scale.\n*   **Failure of Traditional Anonymization:** Standard practices, such as removing names or direct identifiers, are insufficient. LLMs use sophisticated inference to bypass these protections, making true anonymity on the public internet nearly impossible.\n*   **New Privacy Risks:** This capability lowers the barrier for mass surveillance, targeted harassment, and the unmasking of whistleblowers or political dissidents.\n\nUltimately, the article serves as a warning that LLMs have fundamentally changed the privacy landscape. As these models become more pervasive and powerful, the ability to link disparate digital footprints into a comprehensive personal profile is now a tool available to anyone with API access, posing a significant threat to global internet users.",

    "summary": "In “The Misuses of the University,” Siobhán Phillips examines the evolution and current crisis of American higher education by revisiting Clark Kerr’s 1963 concept of the \"multiversity.\" Kerr envisioned the university not as an isolated \"Ivory Tower,\" but as a central \"knowledge industry\" integrated with the needs of the state and the economy. Phillips argues that while Kerr’s vision was prophetic, it laid the groundwork for the modern institution’s decline into corporate extraction and social exploitation.\n\nThe summary highlights several key critiques of the contemporary university:\n\n*   **The Privatization Trap:** Following the \"Great Mistake\" of the late 20th century, universities shifted from being viewed as a public good to a private investment. This led to decreased state funding, skyrocketing tuition, and a reliance on student debt and precarious adjunct labor.\n*   **Predatory Urbanism:** Drawing on Davarian Baldwin’s research, Phillips describes the rise of \"UniverCities.\" Instead of uplifting their surroundings, many wealthy institutions act as predatory real estate developers, using their tax-exempt status to gentrify neighborhoods, displace low-income residents, and expand campus policing.\n*   **Institutional Hypocrisy:** While universities often promote \"diversity and inclusion\" in their marketing, their financial structures frequently reinforce inequality. The \"misuse\" lies in the fact that these institutions prioritize capital accumulation and institutional prestige over their educational and civic missions.\n\nUltimately, Phillips suggests that the modern university has become a \"knowledge factory\" that serves its own administrative growth rather than the public interest. The article calls for a fundamental reimagining of higher education—one that moves beyond Kerr’s industrial model to prioritize genuine social equity and the restoration of the university as a public resource.",

    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/final-2025-data-is-in-us-energy-use-is-up-as-solar-passes-hydro/",
    "summary": "In 2025, solar power achieved a significant milestone by surpassing hydroelectric power for the first time, following a 35% year-over-year growth in generation. Despite this record expansion, a 2.8% rise in overall U.S. electricity demand—driven by data centers, electric vehicles, and heat pumps—outpaced renewable gains.\n\nThe report highlights a complex energy landscape: while solar and wind covered nearly three-quarters of the new demand, the remainder was met by a 13% increase in coal use. This resurgence of coal was influenced by several factors, including rising natural gas prices—driven by increased exports and hardware tariffs—and Trump administration policies aimed at delaying coal plant closures.\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, the outlook for renewables remains strong due to favorable economics. Planned projects include a record 43 GW of solar capacity and 12 GW of wind power, including significant offshore developments and a massive 3.6 GW wind farm in New Mexico. Additionally, the grid is expected to add 24 GW of battery storage, primarily in Texas and California, to manage renewable variability.\n\nUltimately, the U.S. is approaching a pivot point where wind and solar growth may soon fully offset rising demand. However, the current reliance on coal to fill immediate gaps suggests that market dynamics and policy shifts continue to complicate efforts to reduce the grid's overall carbon emissions.",

Unlike many feature-heavy coding agents, Pi follows a \"primitives, not features\" philosophy, providing a lightweight core that users can adapt to their specific workflows through TypeScript extensions, skills, and prompt templates.\n\n**Key Features and Capabilities:**\n*   **Model Flexibility:** Supports over 15 providers (including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google) and hundreds of models. Users can switch models mid-session or cycle through favorites via keyboard shortcuts.\n*   **Context Engineering:** Features advanced context management through project-specific instructions (`AGENTS.md`), custom system prompts (`SYSTEM.md`), and customizable auto-compaction to manage context limits.\n*   **Tree-Structured History:** Sessions are stored as trees, allowing users to navigate to previous points, branch out, and share history via HTML exports or GitHub Gists.\n*   **Extensibility & Packaging:** Users can build or install functionality—such as sub-agents, plan modes, or MCP integration—using TypeScript. These are bundled as \"pi packages\" and shared via npm or Git.\n*   **Execution Control:** A unique queuing system allows for \"steering\" messages (interrupting the agent) or \"follow-up\" messages (waiting for completion).\n\n**Integration & Philosophy:**\nPi operates in four modes: **Interactive** (TUI), **Print/JSON** (for scripting), **RPC**, and an **SDK** for embedding into other apps. \n\nThe tool’s core philosophy is aggressive minimalism. It intentionally excludes built-in features like permission popups, background processes, or pre-defined to-do lists, encouraging users to implement these via extensions or external tools like `tmux`. This approach ensures the tool remains a flexible harness rather than a rigid platform, allowing developers to shape it into their ideal coding assistant.",
